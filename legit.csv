I expect to have both an EPC contract and permits in hand some time around Sep '02 if we start with the expenditures in mid July '01.  Expenditures will be incurred at the rate of approximately $350,000 per month for the next 12 months.  We can back out at any time with only prompt month plus one additional month committed.Costs for a Florida site will be similar; however, expenditures will not start until we achieve site control.My recommendation is to start fully developing the Brownsville, TX site with a plan to flip the site once we have a permit, as market conditions warrant.  I recommend holding off on significant expenditures in Florida until we get more comfortable with site control.Mitch		By 9/02			$000's	Option for land lease		 $       33 	EPC contractor preliminary engineering		 $     300 	Owner's engineer		 $    1,200	Permit Filing - Consultant, etc		 $     800	Detailed Engineering		 $    1,400	Fuel transport study/contract		 $     200 	Geotech studies		 $     400 													Total		 $   4,333	",0

"Bill, why don't you and I get together to discuss the proposal. As you know, we are intending to transfer credit risk through the Project X, Y and Z structures but not likely the most riskier of credits.

"A major bill for direct access at this time is SBXX 27.  This draft bill has language (Section 3 - part e) that would allow the CA DWR to get a fee from direct access customers who return to utility service to avoid imposing costs on other customers or the state. ESPs would have to pay the fee if they send their customers back to bundled utility service. The fee would be ""equivalent to any unvoidable costs imposed on the department's portfolio attributable to the load"" of the returning customer.  ESPs would be required to post a bond or demonstrate insurance coverage before they can serve customers. So far, this latter requirement only applies to ESPs who serve small customers, but I could envision this expanding to all ESPs.",0
"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY?	Senator Keeley Spearheads a New ""Plan B""?	State to Offer Little Aid in PG&E BankruptcyKeeley's Collective ""Plan B""Sources report that additional details for the Plan B have just been ironed out on the Assembly side.  The Assembly is working to announce a plan ""as soon as possible""; this announcement could come this afternoon.  If it is not this afternoon, it will be later this week.   Sources Report the Republicans were working with Keeley, but then felt shut out of the process, so they developed a plan of their own (a lightly publicized point last week).  However, sources believe that the Plan B is very likely to have enough Republican support to pass the Assembly.  The Senate will likely be a much tougher fight, but opposition to the plan remains pessimistic that they will be able to stop it.  The Senate appears likely to broaden the base of people who would have to pay the dedicated rate component, which will be unpopular.  Borrowing from elements of the Joe Nation and Florez ""Plan B's,"" Keeley's new plan is said to:?	Set up a dedicated rate component for SoCal to deal with part of their undercollect.  This dedicated rate component would apply more to ""high-end customers.""  Where the line would be drawn between who would pay and who would not is still subject to negotiation.  The size of the dedicated rate component is also subject to negotiation.  SoCal has suggested $3M for 10 to 12 years.  Note, sources report that at this time, a dedicated rate component for SoCal to pay for power going forward is NOT included in the Plan B that will be announced.  The Assembly is not certain whether this additional dedicated rate component will be needed.  If the bond issuance is enough to cover the cost of power purchases, no dedicated rate component for forward purchases will be needed.  By 2003 and 2004, enough additional generation should be online that power prices should be low.  Therefore, the key question becomes what will be the cost of power in 2002?  If the cost of power is high, rates may have to be increased at that time for SoCal to continue operating.?	The state would make a secured loan (secured against the transmission assets) to SoCal to pay back the remainder of the undercollect.  This loan would be paid back by SoCal granting the government a lower rate of return on the transmission system for a period of 10 to 15 years.  This provides an incentive for SoCal to sell its transmission system to the state, since it would not be making as much money from the system.  Were this to happen, the value would be credited toward the loan.?	In return, the state would receive the withdrawal with prejudice of the filed rate doctrine case.  Also, SoCal would reduce the price of native power generation.  Finally, business customers (including those that would have to pay the dedicated rate component) would have the right to apply for direct access to power.If this plan is passed, (better than 50/50 chance -as reported earlier) the constitutional challenge from Michael Sturmwasser is still likely to go forward.  This is because Sturmwasser is chiefly concerned with the fact that the plan results in a retroactive rate increase to pay SoCal's undercollect.  Sources believe it is likely that SoCal will eventually sell its transmission assets to the state if this plan is passed.  Therefore these assets would become municipal, making the reduction in the PUC's authority constitutional.Legislature Leaves PG&E to Throws of BankruptcyToday, there have been discussions concerning PG&E regarding ""Plan B"" and the legislature.   Currently, the legislature is NOT considering offering Keeley's ""Plan B"" solution to PG&E.  If the Plan B mentioned above passes the Senate, it is more likely that the state will purchase PG&E out of bankruptcy.  Both the Assembly and the Senate leadership are talking seriously about purchasing PG&E out of bankruptcy, though the Republicans remain strongly opposed.  The state then, would likely sell off pieces of PG&E (except for the transmission assets, which it would retain).",0
"Executive Summary:?	Undercollet Remains Sticking Point for Utility Creditors (especially QFs), involuntary bankruptcy likely if issue is not addressed in today's CAPUC hearings?	CAPUC Rate Increase Set at 40%, Pending DWR Power Purchase Details?	Davis Defends No Rate Increase Position, Distances Himself from CAPUCQF/Generator undercollect may be an invitation to involuntary bankruptcyAs reported last week, QF has sitting and waiting to hear what the CAPUC has to say, unfortunately it may not be what the QFs want to hear.  The utilities' undercollect, which will not be addressed in today's CAPUC hearings, could very well provide an invitation for QFs and generators to file involuntary bankruptcy against SoCal and PG&E.  Recent rate hikes proposed by the CAPUC specifically dictate that any revenue generated from rate increases cannot be used to pay off utility past debt, leaving the QF with little hope of recovery.  QFs were obviously dismayed by the CAPUC's draft order and if the decision is passed as it currently reads, an involuntary bankruptcy filing is still likely.CAPUC holds rate increase hearings todayAs reported yesterday, Loretta Lynch released the details of the CAPUC's draft rate increase order last night.  There is expected to be a 3 cent/kwh surcharge on power bills or roughly a 40% rate increase.  A portion of this ""surcharge"" will be given to the DWR to cover its costs and the order concludes that utilities need revenues on a going-forward basis.  Therefore, utilities can only use the revenues for power purchases going forward and are expressly forbidden from using this cash to pay down past debt (ex. QFs).  However, the utilities are ordered to resume payments to the QFs on a going-forward basis.  The net effect of the order is to allow the utilities to operate in case of bankruptcy.One interesting point in the draft is its decision which calls on the utilities to join  with the state in pursuing a refund on the amount overcharged for power by the generators.  The suggestion is that the utilities take legal action against the generators to recoup funds.  Only the funds recovered from generators can be used to pay down the utilities' past debt.  If the utilities choose this course of action, it would be a very lengthy process.  Davis contends with Lynch on CAPUC rate increases.Davis has thus far refused to support CAPUC's proposed rate increase stating the CAPUC decision making board is an independent body and that he continues to believe that a resolution can be found within the current rate structure.  Sources indicate that he is likely to ask for Lynch's letter of resignation, however, there is no indication she will comply.  Senator Burton, who supports the CAPUC's plan, reportedly will protect Lynch by not allowing her to be impeached (which is the only other way she could be removed by the governor).",0
"Executive Summary?	Davis struggles to find Senate support for SoCal transmission deal?	Only chance of deal going through is a one-time quick vote; if deal has to go to hearings - it will probably die?	If not transmission deal, legislators will seize assets and seek price caps?	Asset seizure would target power contracts, then power plants; as a result the endless court battles will ensue, but this gives Davis opportunity to continue to blame generators and marketers?	Bankruptcy for SoCal is still the most likely scenario, with the QFs or SoCal itself likely to file if the transmission deal dies or gets amended?	Congressional democrats rally around Davis and seize opportunity to blame the Administration	Transmission Deal and Democratic SupportAs Governor Gray Davis scrambles to build support for his SoCal Ed. transmission proposal, one thing is evident; the longer the deal is exposed to public debate, the less likely it is to pass.  In fact, politicians have been so leery of the deal that Davis has been unable to locate even one sponsor to introduce the bill in the Senate.  In the eyes of many Democratic legislators (and all Republicans) forcing SoCal Edison into bankruptcy is looking like a better option than buying the transmission lines; that is why the Governor's senior strategists have quietly been trying to schedule a quick ""up or down"" vote on the transmission line purchase as early as next week.  The bill is currently not scheduled to be voted on in effort to avoid debate, however, if there is an opening within the next two weeks and Davis feels he has enough support, it will be pushed through.  Because the SoCal deal needs every piece in place as ""negotiated"" by Davis' team, the team wants no amendments allowed on the Assembly floor and a quick vote.  If this unlikely fast track strategy fails for Davis, the prospects for the transmission lines purchase will deteriorate steadily (keep in mind that that it cannot even be resubmitted to the Assembly until it has been vetted by SoCal Edison attorneys).  According to sources, the legislature is going to try to modify the Memorandum of Understanding between Gov. Davis and SCE.  However, the Senate leadership does not believe there will be sufficient support to pass even a modified MOU. Burton reportedly believes that at least 6 Democrats will vote against it along with the Republicans.  The more that bill gets picked apart in public, the uglier it looks and the more Democrats will realize that they are all alone in supporting it.  Another problem faced by the legislatures is the deal is in favor of SoCal and not the state.  Among other things, the state is overpaying by about $1.5 billion for the transmission lines.  Additionally, the MOU Davis has with SoCal. Ed nearly matches, point for point, the deal Davis condemned with PG&E.Asset SeizuresSince before the PG&E bankruptcy filing, we have maintained that asset seizures through eminent domain would become a major pursuit for increasingly frustrated Democrats.  Davis' legal office has thoroughly scrubbed the law on eminent domain seizures of everything from power generating assets across California to existing power contracts negotiated by, whom Davis's calls, ""profiteering power brokers"".  Of course, everyone in the Governor's office understands that any seizing would immediately end up in state and federal courts, and would be a legal nightmare (there are a few minor Constitutional, legal and interstate commerce problems). The main thing is that the seizing would continue Davis's main approach to this problem -- management by press conference -- and it would put the Governor and Democrats on the right side of the issue -- punishing the capitalist leeches.  According to one senior Democratic legislator, there is movement within Democratic members of the state Assembly to demand that Davis agree to seize the power contracts in return for their vote in favor of the power transmission purchase. Of course, taking the contracts would only be setting a precedent for taking the power plants.  The appeal of seizing the contracts is that it would allegedly put California state officials in charge of where the power is sold and reduce mark-ups substantially as they used the contract power authority to provide spot-market power purchases before peak emergency conditions drive the price through the roof. Price CapsOne strong indication as to whether or not summer price caps will occur depends powerfully on decisions made by the three Republican Governors from Colorado, Alaska and Wyoming. These three were the key players during the Portland Western Governor's Conference last January and, according to senior White House officials, it took the personal and prolonged intervention of President Bush himself to peel these three away from an otherwise unanimous call for price caps from the governors. ""If they had signed that price cap appeal,"" the administration source said, ""we would already have price caps. So if they start to make it clear something has changed, we will have to listen.""  Sources indicate that if these Republican leaders begin to rethink their opposition to price caps, the Bush administration will be forced to reconsider price caps as a remedy for the West. Cost Plus Caps -- Think of these as Republican price caps in that their first duty is to make sure private companies make money and have incentives to provide power into the affected grid. Just to give some idea of magnitudes in a cost plus deal, current discussions would put a cap on power costs at something like $250 per kilowatt hour. That is a long way down from the August futures contract that is pricing in $750 per kilowatt hour, but a long way above last August's $150/kwhr price and a particularly long way above the cost of generating this power, which is something like $25-30/kwh. Market-Price Exceptions -- The option allows the Bush administration to have political credit for imposing price caps. As we write, FERC is currently ,in the process of considering permit renewals for five companies generating power in California (Duke, Dynegy, AES, Reliant and Williams).  The permit grants a further three-year waiver that allows them to sell power into California in the existing ""whatever price the market will bear"".  In other words, FERC could simply not grant these companies the right to sell energy at the market price, perhaps by changing a definition of controlling market share, and then power to control prices would revert back to FERC. Technically, in granting the extension of these permits, FERC has to establish a formal finding that the five power companies do not wield ""market power"" -- that means they cannot affect the price of energy by withholding power at crucial times. Of course, FERC has just found on three different rulings in the last four months that the companies wield exactly that kind of ability over market prices and has ordered minor rebates to adjust for the subsequent price spikes. But that would mean FERC would have to want to wield effective power over price capping in California and they have shown no desire on that front. The escape clause for FERC simply to renew the waivers is that they are routinely renewed unless the company applying for waivers controls more than 20% of an electricity market and none of these companies come close.In other words, the waivers option lets FERC escape if the Bush administration and FERC commissioners really want to escape. Once again, that decision may be more in the hands of the three Republican Governors than anywhere else in the country. But you can be certain that in the past few days Administration officials have become fully aware of the potential political liabilities of doing nothing except advocating more nuclear and coal power plants. Democrats Seize Opportunity to blame BushSenior political leaders now think the total energy bill for the year could come in as high as $60 billion, which would destroy state finances for a decade.  Add to that the constant drumbeat of numbers that voters hear everyday about their own direct out-of-pocket electricity costs (they paid $7 billion for electricity in 1999, $27 billion in 2000 and are expected to pay $70 billion this year -- ten times the rate two years ago. Then, of course, they open bills with massive rate increases that bring all those incredible numbers home in a very direct way, and, well, who can blame the Democrats for saying there is a simple solution, but the White House won't allow it.National level Democrats realize California's power crisis is a prime opportunity to chastise the Bush administration and its free-market advocate, FERC Chairman Hebert, over their resistance to summer price caps.  As California's leaders calculate this year's taxpayer energy bill at potentially $60 billion, a rogue's gallery of Democratic congressional leaders are currently meeting with Governor Davis and coordinating efforts to fan out across the eight western states of the power grid with a singular message: ""the solution to all western voters electricity problems lies right in Washington DC, at FERC headquarters controlled by Bush Administration appointees.""  And as the political dialogue takes on a more aggressive national tone and its possible impact on control over the US Congress comes more into focus, the solutions articulated by California's Democrats who sense they have Republicans on the run in the West become less and less ""free market"" focused.  The two strains of the Democratic solution that are becoming an unavoidable part of the energy picture are asset seizures and price caps.  ",0

"The Commission discussed its market based rate policy at today's meeting.  They did not vote out an order today, but expect to take up this issue again next meeting.  The staff memo recommended the following:For an interim period, FERC will deal with pending requests for market based rates and with triennial reviews of those rate authorizations, using a new test called the ""Supply Margin Assessment"" (also called a jazzed up version of the hub and spoke test) where a seller's capacity will be reviewed against the generation reserve margin in a market.  The test takes into account constraints based on TTC.  If the capacity of a seller is not necessary to meet peak demand,the seller does not have market power.  This test is applicable to all markets that are not part of an existing RTO or ISO.  For those selling into an RTO/ISO, the FERC will continue to allow market based rates subject to the market monitor and mitigation.  Staff also recommends that FERC initiate a Section 206 investigation to require each seller with market based rate authority to change its tariff by adding a provision stating that if the seller acts in an anticompetitive manner, the FERC can require refunds.  Through questioning by Commissioner Massey, it was revealed that, even if a seller did not engage in bad behavior, but sold into a disfunctional market, refunds could be required.  In the staff memo, apparently staff had left vague the definition of anticompetitive behavior in order to be able to interpret it most broadly.  However, Commissioners asked staff to better define the anticompetitive actions that could trigger refunds.  This policy will be brought up again at the next Commission meeting on October 11.  It will be issued as a proposed action, giving parties an opportunity to comment within 15 days and then also file reply comments,  Final action is expected within 60-90 days.Last, for the long-term, FERC will hold outreach meetings looking for answers as to how to detect market power and what to do when it is detected.  Since the interim measure is only a ""snapshot"" approach according to Commissioner Massey, he is willing to support it only along with the above described tariff provision.  Commissioner Breathitt is very uncomfortable with an open refund requirement, stating that it adds to regulatory uncertainty at a time when the Commission is most interested in giving certainty to the industry in order to assure reliability.",0

"FYI.  TJ and Claudette -- please forward to your groups.  Thanks. -----Original Message-----From: 	Walton, Steve  Sent:	Wednesday, October 17, 2001 10:17 PM  RTO WeekDay 2 -- October 16, 2001Transmission Planning & ExpansionThe afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The panelists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, Steve Walton--Enron.General ObservationsThe Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from time to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in questioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initial presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There was some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, however, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmission rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the RTO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (where are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possible that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  There was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identification of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had to be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge is who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution.  Opening StatementsJose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system operator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of investment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load.  Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affects all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of lines requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The idea of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state projects, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been used by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered.Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning process which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) is the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and resources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO needs a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market should decide on solutions.  Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we have now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has taken conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be answered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmission projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for expansions?  Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  You are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 138 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.DiscussionKevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current congestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discussion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions.  Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmission planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  Laura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not having proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn't.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage hydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing model but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch, but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""tweaks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permit  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load coal.In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1) RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO should be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was critical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased since it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountability is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.Steve",0

"This story reflects fairly well the debate underway regarding the DA suspension date.The Treasurer, Angelides, is taking a hard line.  We are working with others to get the date pushed back.California PUC staff has started calling around trying to estimate how many customers have very recently switched or are trying to.  They have made inquiries to our customers, including UC/CSU.Best,JeffState fights 6,000 firms' energy deals Discount power contracts deemed unfair to consumers Bernadette Tansey, Chronicle Staff Writer mailto:btansey@sfchronicle.comSunday, September 2, 2001 ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle /chronicle/info/copyright URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/09/02/MN155174.DTLThousands of California businesses may reap cost breaks on electricity while other utility customers live with record rate hikes if the state lets stand a spurt of last-minute contracts with private power suppliers. More than 6,000 firms, including big retail chains and industrial plants, signed discounted power contracts in July and August as market prices dropped. State officials are incensed, saying the private ""direct access"" contracts with electricity providers could shift the burden for millions of dollars in state power purchases onto households and small businesses. State Treasurer Phil Angelides said the same companies that benefited as the state depleted its budget surplus to keep the lights on now want to escape paying their share of the billions spent to ensure power supplies for California. ""I think it's wrong and it's immoral,"" Angelides said. State officials argue that the summer contracts can still be canceled retroactively because California businesses were on notice that their option to shop around for better deals on electricity was about to be suspended by the state Public Utilities Commission. The PUC is set to consider the retroactive ban Thursday. But energy firms say the summer deals were perfectly legal because the PUC had not yet taken action and made a series of draft decisions that put off the effective date of the direct access ban until as late as yesterday. ""The drafts were not consistent,"" said Tracy Fairchild, a spokeswoman for Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, a consortium of generators and energy suppliers. ""Which one were we supposed to take seriously?"" The energy trade group is threatening to sue to protect the summer contracts. Angelides fears that a prolonged court fight could block a $12.5 billion state bond sale to reimburse the treasury for California's emergency power purchases. The burgeoning conflict is part of a continuing fight by energy firms and some of their business customers to preserve direct access -- a core provision of the state's 1996 deregulation law. Deregulation supporters predicted energy consumers would enjoy lower prices if private generators were allowed to compete with the utilities as power suppliers. But the direct access program was thrown into disarray last year when wholesale electricity prices skyrocketed and the state stepped in to buy power. To make sure the state's outlay would be paid back by all ratepayers, the Legislature in January directed the PUC to suspend direct access. By that time, most direct access customers were fleeing back to the utilities to benefit from a rate cap that protected them from the soaring market power prices. The PUC postponed action on the direct access ban while some legislators were sponsoring bills that would have allowed the program to continue under certain conditions. But by July, market prices had come down, and energy providers like Enron Energy Services, AES New Energy and Strategic Energy were again offering direct access contracts. Businesses were looking for relief from the record rate hikes imposed on utility customers in June, said Phoenix energy consultant Gina Coleman. Coleman said she helped five retail chains with ""a significant number"" of stores in California negotiate contracts with Strategic Energy this summer. ""Business is business, and if you can get a better price for something, you should,"" said Coleman, who declined to name her clients. She said the lower costs will help the stores keep doing business in California and hold their prices down. Daniel Douglass, an attorney for the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, said any attempt by the state to cancel contracts retroactively would violate the constitutional law. He said energy firms have purchased power to serve their customers under the contracts and would suffer losses if they were canceled. Angelides said the same firms that ran to the state for protection when their market contracts became too expensive now want to take advantage of lower power prices he attributes to the stabilizing effect of the state's long- term power contracts. ""You can't take advantage of the state's stabilizing the rates, then say, 'Thank you very much,' and stick everyone else with the bill,"" Angelides said. State officials have not tallied the total number of customers who signed up in July and August, nor have they estimated the revenue loss that would have to be covered by remaining utility ratepayers. Figures compiled by the PUC show that commercial and industrial firms signed more than 6,000 new direct access contracts in July alone. A rough calculation suggests that, as a result, the firms might contribute as much as $64 million less annually to the repayment of state costs. The loss might not be significant enough to risk a court fight that would delay the bond sale, state officials said. Bu Angelides said the same power firms that helped create the energy crisis by charging exorbitant rates are now threatening a bond issue desperately needed to restore funds needed for education, health care and children's services. ""What they're talking about doing,"" he said, ""is holding us hostage until they get what they want.""

While, on the     surface, Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an     auction, the posted prices for any product may not be the result     of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers; in fact,     for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to     sell at, and for purchases the posted prices represent what EPMI     is willing to buy at.FERC left open the idea that PGE could re-file to fix the affiliate abuse.As soon as we hear anything else, I'll let you know.Jim -----Original Message-----From: 	Shapiro, Richard  Sent:	Friday, July 20, 2001 4:14 PMTo:	Steffes, James D.Subject:	FW: Portland General Electric:  Order Rejecting Tariff Amendments -----Original Message-----From: 	Novosel, Sarah  Sent:	Friday, July 20, 2001 10:42 AMTo:	Robertson, Linda; Shapiro, Richard; Steffes, James D.Subject:	Portland General Electric:  Order Rejecting Tariff Amendments----- Forwarded by Sarah Novosel/Corp/Enron on 07/20/2001 11:39 AM -----	""EMILY HARRIS"" eharris@bracepatt.com 07/20/2001 11:14 AM 	   To: alan.comnes@enron.com, Christi.L.Nicolay@enron.com, donna.fulton@enron.com, ray.alvarez@enron.com, smara@enron.com, snovose@enron.com, sscott3@enron.com, thane.twiggs@enron.com  cc: ""Andrea Settanni"" asettanni@bracepatt.com  Subject: Portland General Electric:  Order Rejecting Tariff Amendments	                                           96 FERC    61, 093                          UNITED STATES OF AMERICA                    FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION     Before Commissioners: Curt H*bert, Jr., Chairman;                          William L.

Portland General Electric Company         Docket No. ER01-2097-000     Enron Power Marketing, Inc.                  Docket No. ER01-2103-000ORDER REJECTING TARIFF AMENDMENTS WITHOUT           PREJUDICE                           (Issued July 20, 2001)          In this order we reject, without prejudice, proposed     amendments of Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (EPMI) and Portland     General Electric (PGE) to their respective market-based rate     tariffs that would allow them to make inter-affiliate sales using     the EnronOnline trading platform.     I.   Background          On May 22, 2001, in separate filings, affiliates PGE in     Docket No. ER01-2097-000 and EPMI in Docket No. ER01-2103-000     (collectively Applicants) filed to amend their respective market-     based rate schedules to allow for inter-affiliate sales through     the EnronOnline trading platform, and to prohibit communication     among affiliates regarding the contents of prices posted on     EnronOnline or the times that PGE will be making trades on                 1     EnronOnline.   This amendment does not supplant the existing     provisions of PGE's and EPMI's currently effective tariffs which     allow for inter-affiliate sales subject to conditions that the     Commission generally imposes on inter-affiliate sales where there     are captive customers, e.g., allowing a public utility to sell to     its affiliated power marketer only at a rate that is no lower     than the rate it charges non-affiliates, requiring simultaneous     offers to non-affiliates, or requiring use of a relevant,     established index.  Rather, PGE and EPMI propose to amend their     respective tariffs to add a provision by which they will make               1                The EnronOnline system is administered by Enron Networks,          an Enron Corp. subsidiary.  EnronOnline is a free, Internet-          based, transaction system which allows EPMI's customers to view          real time prices from EPMI's traders and transact instantly          online.  EnronOnline is not an EPMI application, but rather          EnronOnline is a trading platform used as a tool by EPMI in          buying from and selling power to third parties.          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -2-          and ER01-2103-000     inter-affiliate sales via EnronOnline, with restrictions     different than those in place but that, they state, will still     prevent affiliate abuse.  Applicants state that the Commission's     requirements have become outdated due to recent developments in     electronic commerce and, in particular, the Commission's     requirement that ""PGE post on its website notice of a potential     purchase or sale with EPMI prior to PGE entering into the     transaction with EPMI prohibits PGE from using EnronOnline, since     EnronOnline offers only instantaneous transactions that do not     provide for a waiting period before consummating the                  2     transaction.""   According to Applicants, this deprives PGE of the     ability to buy or sell power ""from perhaps the largest marketer                                                                3     in its region, to the detriment of PGE and its ratepayers.""     II.  Notice of Filing and Interventions/Protests          Notices of the filings were published in the Federal     Register, 66 Fed. Reg. 29,939 (2001) (Docket No. ER01-2097-000),     and 66 Fed. Reg. 30,180 (2001) (Docket No. ER01-2103-000), with     motions to intervene and protests for both due on or before     June 12, 2001.  None was filed.     III. Discussion          The Commission allows power marketers and their public     utility affiliates to sell to one another at market-based rates     when it can be assured that there is no possibility of affiliate     abuse.  As the Commission has explained, affiliate abuse can     occur when a traditional public utility with captive customers     sells power at below-market prices to, or purchases power at     above-market prices from, an affiliate without captive customers     (such as a power marketer affiliate).  One way in which the     Commission has sought to prevent this type of cross-subsidization     by captive customers is to require the pricing of inter-affiliate                                                             4     sales at an established, relevant market price or index.     Another way, when there is no assurance that the affiliates are     transacting at the prevailing market price, is to adopt various     conditions previously established by the Commission to prevent                     5     affiliate abuse.               2                EPMI Application at 3; PGE Application at 4.               3                EPMI Application at 3; PGE Application at 4.               4                See, e.g., DPL Energy, Inc. 90 FERC   61,200 (2000);          accord, First Energy Trading Services, Inc., 88 FERC   61,067 at          61,156 (1999).               5                E.g., GPU Advanced Resources, Inc., 81 FERC   61,335 at                                                        (continued...)          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -3-          and ER01-2103-000          Here, Applicants request that the Commission permit them to     use EnronOnline to make inter-affiliate sales, subject to the     following restrictions that they contend provide sufficient     protection against affiliate abuse.  PGE, when buying from EPMI     using EnronOnline, will be required to ""take the transaction     price as posted that is generally applicable at a particular                                                              6     location without attempting to negotiate any adjustment.""   In                                                                  7     addition, PGE will be prohibited from submitting Limit Orders  or     engaging in any other type of transaction in which the identity     of the counter-party is revealed to EPMI prior to the transaction     being finalized.  Applicants also propose to amend their     respective codes of conduct to preclude any communication     regarding prices posted on EnronOnline.          Applicants contend such restrictions ensure no affiliate     abuse occurs since PGE will only be able to transact with EPMI at          5           (...continued)          62,539 (1997) (GPU); Detroit Edison Company, 80 FERC   61,348 at          62,197-98 (1997) (Detroit Edison).  In GPU, the Commission          allowed sales from a power marketer to its affiliated traditional          public utility at a rate that was no higher than the lowest rate          the public utility paid non-affiliates under certain standard          supplier agreements.  Accord, First Energy Trading & Power          Marketing, Inc., 84 FERC   61,214 at 62,037-38, reh'g denied, 85          FERC   61,311 (1998).  Detroit Edison provided that a traditional          public utility may sell power to its affiliated power marketer          only at a rate that is no lower than the rate it charges non-          affiliates; that the utility simultaneously offer through its          electronic bulletin board to sell to non-affiliates at the same          rate offered to its affiliate; and that all prices charged to the          affiliate be simultaneously posted on its electronic bulletin          board.  Accord, Jersey Central Power & Light Co., 82 FERC          61,023 at 61,071 (1998); Commonwealth Edison Co., 85 FERC          61,288 at 62,176-77 (1998).               6                EPMI Application at 4; PGE Application at 5.               7                In the case of a Limit Order on EnronOnline, EPMI would          know the identity of the customer requesting a price higher or          lower than that currently available.  Applications at 3.  While          Applicants do not define ""Limit Order,"" the common understanding          is that, unlike a market order, which instructs a broker to          transact immediately at whatever price is currently available in          the marketplace, a limit order instructs a broker to fill the          order only if certain conditions are met.  Generally, a limit          order may be either a day order, in which case it expires when          the market closes if unfilled, or good-until-canceled, in which          case the limit order lasts until executed or canceled.          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -4-          and ER01-2103-000     the posted price (a price that is offered to all market     participants) and there will be no transactions in which EPMI     knows that PGE is the counter-party before the transaction is     finalized.  Thus, Applicants contend that not only will PGE be     unable to negotiate special terms with EPMI through EnronOnline,     but EPMI will have no discretion to take actions which favor PGE.     Applicants further offer that procedures are performed by     computer and are not left to the discretion of any affiliate of     PGE.  In addition, because the EnronOnline price is posted     electronically and is available to all market participants,     Applicants state that PGE's customers have the opportunity to     transact with EPMI on EnronOnline on the same terms and     conditions that are available to PGE.          Applicants have failed to demonstrate that their proposed     restrictions provide the same protections afforded under the     Commission's affiliate abuse requirements and conditions (e.g.,     protection against PGE buying too high or selling too low in its                                           8     transactions with its affiliate EPMI).   The thrust of     Applicants' argument is that the Commission's affiliate abuse     concerns are satisfied by using EnronOnline, a public medium, for     selling power between affiliates.  We disagree.  While perhaps     faster and easier to use than phone calls, faxes, or letters, an     Internet-based platform is just another medium for trade, and     speed and ease of use do not dictate that the Commission's     affiliate abuse concerns have been satisfied.  There is, for     example, no assurance that the posted prices on EnronOnline                                        9     represent prevailing market prices.          Applicants contend that, since PGE can transact with EPMI     via EnronOnline only at the posted price, there can be no     affiliate abuse.  We are not certain, however, that the posted     price necessarily represents the market price.  While, on the     surface, Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an     auction, the posted prices for any product may not be the result     of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers; in fact,     for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to     sell at, and for purchases the posted prices represent what EPMI                          10     is willing to buy at.    For other transactions through media     other than EnronOnline, including other exchanges, EPMI might be               8                See supra notes 4-5 and accompanying text (citing cases          that discuss Commission's underlying concerns with affiliate          power sales).               9                See supra note 4 and accompanying text.               10                 All transaction on EnronOnline involve EPMI as a          participant.  For sales, EPMI is the seller.  For purchases, EPMI          is the buyer.          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -5-          and ER01-2103-000                                                              11     willing to sell at lower prices and buy at higher prices.     Moreover, Applicants provide no information about how product     prices posted by EPMI are determined, or whether there would be     any restrictions on what products PGE could trade via     EnronOnline, or even whether there are other similar, but non-     affiliated, Internet-based venues where PGE can electronically     trade those products to attain similar benefits.          Having failed to convince us that these affiliates will be     transacting at a prevailing market price via EnronOnline, we now     turn to whether the Applicants have met other conditions     established by the Commission to prevent affiliate abuse.     Regarding transactions in which EPMI may be purchasing from PGE     through EnronOnline, there is nothing in the Applicants' proposed     restrictions that would require PGE to     simultaneously offer to sell to non-affiliates at the same rate     offered to the affiliate.  The Commission requires that, with     respect to any power offered to its affiliate, PGE make the same     offer to unaffiliated entities at the same time through its     electronic bulletin board.  But it is unclear whether PGE can or     will make the same offer to non-affiliates.          Applicants also offer as a protection that PGE is prohibited     from submitting Limit Orders, which would prevent EPMI from     knowing that PGE is the counter-party to a transaction.  Again,     this would not prevent EPMI from selling power to PGE at above-     market prices.          The Commission is not assured by the Applicants' proposal     that transactions between PGE and EPMI conducted via EnronOnline     will occur in a manner that is consistent with the Commission's     expectations regarding transparent and reasonable prices for     inter-affiliate power sales transactions.  There is, for example,     no provision in the proposed amendments regarding how     unaffiliated customers, or other interested parties, would     monitor inter-affiliate transactions.          For the above reasons, we will reject the proposed     amendments, without prejudice to Applicants revising their     proposal to address the Commission's concerns and incorporating     appropriate restrictions to protect against affiliate abuse.               11                 Likewise, PGE might be willing to buy at lower prices and          sell at higher prices.          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -6-          and ER01-2103-000     The Commission orders:          Applicants' proposed tariff amendments are hereby rejected,     without prejudice, as discussed in the body of this order.

SoCal Edison Eyeing BankruptcyCalifornia Senate & SoCal's Fate With the California Assembly's passage of SB 78XX last week, Senator John Burton (President Pro Tem) is positioned as perhaps the most legislatively powerful man in California.  Maintaining his hard line against the Assembly's amendments to SB78XX, Burton has completely rejected SB78 XX and has instead revived a previously introduced Assembly bill (AB 67XX), which had not faced a Senate floor vote.  The majority of AB 67XX's original language has been gutted by Burton and discretely replaced with the following points:?	Financing of the dedicated rate component has been modified to incorporate a smaller rate base consisting of consumers using only 70 kv or more (formerly users as low as 20 kv were included).  The 70 kv value is rumored closer to 120 kv.?	The state will have a 5-year option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets at twice book value and SoCal will be allowed to transfer profits from the sale to their parent company.?	A renewables portfolio equal to 20% of total generation must be in place by 2010.  ?	There is an 11.6% return on generation in the bill.?	The amount authorized for SoCal's bond issuance has been lowered from $2.9B to $2.5B.  ?	Direct access language has been included in the bailout bill.  The exact language, which was developed by Senator Bowen's office, is not yet known, however, earlier versions suggest that all parties will be forced to pay exit fees, switch providers no earlier than 2003, and there will be no cost shifting away from the DWR. (Note: Senator Burton is reportedly listening carefully to Treasurer Angelides' arguments about the revenue bonds not selling if direct access is included.)It is doubtful that Burton will insist on the loyalty of fellow Democrats and will preferably discourage the bill's support.  The arrival of AB67 XX on the Senate floor may be little more than Burton's civil compliance with Gov. Davis' request.  All Republicans and at least 5 Democrats are expected to vote against the bill; an additional two dissenting Democrat votes would effectively block AB67 XX.  Consumer advocates that adamantly oppose this bill (because it lacks the state's ownership of hard transmission assets and burdens residential consumers with excessive rates) are ""optimistic"" about the bill's defeat in the Senate.  Despite these circumstances, it is highly conceivable that the Senate could pass along a virtually ineffective & inadequate bailout package for the Assembly's approval.Burton is reportedly avoiding discourse with Davis over AB67 XX and as the hours pass ever closer to the midnight deadline, Burton will likely introduce the bill for floor vote and then hurriedly adjourn the Senate.  If the bill passes, the Assembly will bare the difficult task of either accepting the bill as is, or reject the bill and risk SoCal's bankruptcy.  We believe that if the bill makes it into the Assembly, AB67 XX will pass despite strong opposition from both the CTMA and consumer advocates.  There is no current vote count available in the Assembly, but we expect the Assembly to debate the bill into the early hours of Saturday morning. Inside Edison There are still strong indications that even if a bailout plan is passed, SoCal will voluntarily file for bankruptcy or a creditor, most likely a generator, will take them into bankruptcy.  SoCal remains concerned due to the number of contingent claims on their cash (by the DWR, etc.) and appear likely to try to protect these cash flows.  From the generators' perspective, if a plan is passed, the bank creditors will get paid but they will not.  Also, the DWR and ISO have not resolved even what amount is owed to generators for power they have provided this year, let alone when they will be paid.  The total amount owed through the ISO is approximately $2B.  Nonetheless, the generators remain under a federal order to provide power to the state.  Once a deal is passed leaving too little money for SoCal to pay the generators, this will leave them with little means of satisfaction other than filing against SoCal.SoCal has privately indicated to Senators that if the AB 67XX fails to include any consumer using 100 kv or more as the base for the dedicated rate component, SoCal will be forced to file for bankruptcy because of their inability to effectively securitize the bailout bonds.  SoCal feels that this rate base is too small and the risk of these businesses fleeing the state is too high.  The CTMA also has indicated that some of its members may leave the state to avoid having to pay the extra surcharge on power.  SoCal has not communicated a position on whether the $400 million trim (from the original $2.9B) puts them into bankruptcy. We estimate that an additional $400 million hit is indeed too much to bear and would prompt a voluntary bankruptcy petition. ",0

BC Hydro's Rate Freeze Lingers?	BPA Rates Expected to Rise, California Refunds DoubtfulAluminum Smelters (DSI's)On 1 October 2001 the long-term relationship between DSI's and BPA for preferred rates will end as Bonneville Power Administration's new rate case takes effect.  After 2001, DSI's become discretionary customers of Bonneville Power Administration.  DSI's have been playing the game of slowly 'migrating' their load to local utilities in 9.9mW annual increments to avoid being subject to Bonneville's New Large Single Load (NLSL) designation and losing their preferred rate status.  Now they are beginning to slip quietly back onto BPA's federal system, and officials at Bonneville have been willing partners in attempting to circumvent their own NLSL regulations, which were established in 1980.  In an effort to secure existing DSI relationships, BPA is now undertaking a review of its NLSL regulation to provide an exemption for these companies.  BPA is opposed by the Public Power Council, the representative of the public utilities in the Pacific Northwest that focuses BPA rate-making, which has sent a letter to the Assistant Secretary of Energy to express its objections to BPA's proposed actions.  The PPC was instrumental in raising public awareness earlier this year about the favored status of the DSI's as large industrial customers - they are moving aggressively to block BPA from giving the aluminum smelters any additional favored treatment.The ability of BPA to exempt DSI's from its NLSL regulation will shape the direction of negotiations between aluminum smelters and other power producers in the region.  It remains to be seen whether or not the Public Power Council will initiate a legal battle to stop the DSI's from obtaining this special treatment.  While moving to maintain positive relationships with the DSI's, BPA is not enthusiastic about giving power back to the smelters because they think they will need all the water they can spare for the fish.  BPA has concerns that supplies will be tight again in the fall and early winter - they won't really benefit much, even from normal or better precipitation, until the melt starts next April.  BPA wants to buy back power from the smelters for at least a year and probably would not entertain any overtures from smelters until then.  About the only possibility for smelters to go back on line would be for them to use the money they're getting from BPA to subsidize power purchases on the spot market.  However, there would be a lot of risk in that, and BPA people don't think market prices would enable them to be very profitable, even with the BPA money helping. As of April 1, three smelters should come back on line; NW Aluminum, Goldendale Aluminum, Longville Aluminum?	Alcoa AluminumThere is not much news happening on the negotiating end between Alcoa and BC Hydro right now.  Information is still fairly tight-lipped, however, employees of Alcoa's idled Intalco smelter have been shifted to other capital projects in the facility to prepare the plant for an eventual restart.  This may indicate the direction of negotiations.?	Kaiser AluminumAs odd man out, Kaiser has little to say in Northwestern energy developments.  The company will obviously benefit if Bonneville is able to fight off the public utilities, but they are in such a weak bargaining position right now that they might have to restart operations just to get revenues moving again, though there is no direct evidence to support this view at this time.British Columbia Politics?	BC GovernmentThe latest news from British Columbia is that the BC Liberal government is doing quite nicely in implementing its conservative strategy.  Public opinion remains quite high, and they have virtually completed all of their campaign promises for the first 90-day period.  Even former NDP legislators are surprised at the efficiency with which the government is proceeding.  Political strategists are watching the ANWR vote in the US very carefully, not only because it will have a major impact on the natural gas and oil pipeline going through Northern BC, but also because it is illustrating the environment vs. labor fallout.  In the recent election, the Green Party of British Columbia performed surprisingly well, garnering around 12% of the vote in any typical race, contributing directly to the downfall of the NDP.Premier Gordon Campbell's core review of BC Government is due by October, and it appears that the process will be primarily a cost-cutting measure.  They are moving to reduce expenditures, which for BC Hydro's sake, will include community outreach, student scholarship and any other 'feel good' programs currently being undertaken by Hydro.The real long-term policy planning, however, is expected to take place in January when Campbell's team (Brenda Eaton, the Deputy Premiere; Doug Allen, the Premiere's consultant; and Jack Ebbels, Deputy Energy Minister) works in conjunction with Neufeld to construct BC's long-term energy plan. BC HydroBC Hydro has formally signed on as a participant in the RTO West regional transmission organization as a filing utility.  RTO West is currently being overseen by the Western Governor's Association and developed as allowed by FERC.  RTO West will be the oversight entity in the western states and Canada that will manage electricity transmission issues.  We are also expecting Alberta to come on board RTO West shortly.With regard to a potential rate hearing, BC Hydro has recently put a freeze on rates in the province that will last until 2003.  The word on this move is that it will allow Chairman Bell to generate some political cover as he begins to shave off parts of the business, such as transmission and information technology - focusing BC Hydro's core operations on additional generation, exports/trading, and delivery.  The public concern over privatization is that it will cause rates to skyrocket, similar to what happened in California - but Bell has moved to head off these concerns with the rate freeze.As a function of increasing BC Hydro's generation capacity, they are looking very carefully at building on two sites:  Site C (hydroelectric dam) and Burrard Thermal.  BPA?	Financial StatusIn what was expected to be a quiet period in rates matters, BPA dropped a bombshell by announcing it was considering triggering the FB CRAC on 1 October. This would increase rates over the 46% LB CRAC rate increase announced earlier -- despite forecasts that such an increase would be unnecessary.  What this essentially does is allow BPA to bypass its initial rate case increase of 46%, utilizing a stop-gap measure under federal regulations.BPA cited a number of reasons why it was considering imposing an FB CRAC, including losses trading power this summer, changes in the accounting treatment of some DSI buyouts, and uncertainty whether the California ISO and PX can pay monies owed BPA.  BPA did note, however, that it also had more than one hundred million additional dollars in bond refinancing money not accounted in the FB CRAC calculation.  If the FB CRAC triggers by any amount, BPA would have the option of ""truing up"" its calculation of the FB CRAC in March and could change the rates again if BPA's actual financial condition on 30 September differs from what is estimated now, or if BPA changes its accounting assumptions further.BPA representatives suggest strongly that there is a good chance that a rate increase would be announced early and also indicated that the specific number would be much less than the earlier load-based CRAC increase (of about 46%) -- ""much less than 20%, and probably much, much less than 20%.""The Public Power Council staff has written to and met with Steve Wright, BPA Acting Administrator, in an effort to convince BPA that a FC CRAC is unnecessary.  We should know BPA's decision by 31 August.  ?	FERC RefundsAt this time, BPA will not seek refunds in the ongoing FERC proceedings - or submit to the process for purposes of others seeking refunds against BPA-for the following reasons:1)	BPA believes FERC lacks jurisdiction over BPA.2)	The proceedings are so convoluted (and the transactions so complicated) that BPA asserts that there is no realistic hope of unwinding all of the transactions necessary to equitably order refunds.  Insofar as other parties collecting against BPA, in some cases BPA was only the remarketing agent acting at the behest of, for example, aluminum smelters.  FERC would have to proceed against these third parties, and often that money has already been spent.3)	With respect to claims by the Calif. DWR ($71 million), a similar claim in the separate California FERC proceeding was disallowed on 14 June.  It would be incongruous to allow the claim here.  In this claim, FERC denied DWR access to refunds in situations where there was a willing buyer and willing seller.4)	Then there are the assorted politics involved.  First, BPA believes that the political costs of pursuing refunds outweigh any eventual benefit that might be received.  BPA calculates its potential exposure in these refund proceedings at circa $400 million, while it believes its own potential claims could amount to $500 million-thus a potential $100 million net gain.  For reasons cited, however, we believe it highly unlikely they will seek refunds.  Second, with respect to others seeking refunds against BPA, five NW senators who sit on the Senate Energy Committee would be very upset if FERC allowed California parties to collect against BPA; and FERC to some extent is likely to be responsive to this sentiment.BPA is confident of its legal position in this matter estimating less than a 10% chance of their being forced to submit to FERC in this matter.  Of course, if they were forced to submit to FERC jurisdiction, they would cross claim against other parties and seek refunds.  Even if BPA received refunds, we do not believe that it would affect the ability of aluminum smelters to come back on-line.  We anticipate that on 1 April 2002, three smelters (amounting to between 300-500 MW) will come back on line: Northwest Aluminum & Goldendale Aluminum (230 MW), and Longville Aluminum (100 MW).?	Spill-Related IssuesFish returns for this year have been especially high.  If the ocean stays productive for the next few years, as some think it might, the region could have an enormous opportunity to rebuild the salmon and steelhead runs and make huge strides towards success in this area.Behind-the-scenes work continues on the Implementation Plan (on the Biological Opinion on the hydro system), with the region's states and tribes trying to play a stronger role in designing the Columbia River strategy.PPC and Northwest Irrigation Utilities were admitted to the National Wildlife Federation et al v. NMFS lawsuit as defendant interveners, and the court is now making plans to try mediation between the parties.",0
"John/Louise/Rob:I thought I would fire off a quick note to inform you that Duke produced a non-binding bid for the entire Sundance B PPA.  Duke's bid is C$180,000,000.  This compares to an earlier bid of C$120,000,000 to C$140,000,000 for one unit on July 10, 2001.  Duke's bid combined with the cost structure of the PPA would have Duke buying the PPA for approximately C$35.50/MW or US$22.50/MW. The mark-to-market value of both the Sundance units as of September 18th's curves was C$178,120,374.  Therefore, a sale to Duke at C$180 MM would not provide any significant increase to earnings.  Additionally, it must be noted that the curves have some very conservative heat rate assumptions built into to the latter years.Based on a conversation with John last week,  he clearly indicated that selling the PPA for under US$25.00/MW is not acceptable.  I would agree with John that Enron would better be served by maintaining its current position than accept a bid reflecting a price less than US$25.00 .  It must be noted that Duke's bid expires at 5:00pm CDT, September 21.  Therefore, if anyone feels strongly that we should move forward with Duke we should address it immediately.  Otherwise, Don Miller and I continue to position Enron for the division of the PPA and subsequent auction.Derek",0

These will both become effective April 2002.     Philip Lofts will move to Stamford to take responsibility as Chief     Credit Officer, Americas. Philip has worked for UBS for 18 years and     since 1998 has been Chief Credit Officer Asia/Pacific, working out of     first Tokyo and then Hong Kong.  Prior to moving into CRC, Philip     managed the Structured Finance business in Tokyo, having joined UBS     originally in London.     In addition to supporting UBS-W with sound credit decision making in a     very challenging period in Asia, and establishing himself as a     valuable member of the Regional Management team, Philip led the CRC     teams which successfully delivered two key projects to introduce new     methodology and technology into CRC. Philip is deputy to Ian Drew as     UBSW CCO, holding his credit authority in his absence.     Bill Glass will assume responsibility as Chief Credit Officer, Asia/     Pacific, based in Hong Kong.  Bill has worked within UBS for 16 years     and since 1999 has been Chief Credit Officer, Americas.  Bill's career     has been centred in CRC, where he has worked in Asia, Europe and the     United States.  He was Head of Credit in Tokyo for 2 years, followed     by a period working directly for the UBS Group Chief Credit Officer in     Zurich. Prior to his current position he was Deputy CCO, EMEA, based     in London.     Bill has been particularly instrumental in supporting the development     of the Leveraged Finance business in UBS-W, a field where his advanced     credit decision making skills have been extremely important.

"Sorry for the delay...Las Vegas:Signed up.  Only condition is HSR.  The team is putting together a transition plan to deal with communications,  ongoing development, bank interfaces and closing schedules.  Saguaro:Submitted non-binding low bid last week to acquire Mission's 50% interest.  Waiting for Jeff Donahue to work out the engagement letter with CSFB for the more likely scenario (selling our 15% interest).  I spoke with him Friday and he was going to deal with it today.  (This episode was pretty silly - after Andy requested his group's involvement I sent Andy a draft, then sent drafts to Donohue, Metts, Glisan, then called Donahue, Metts, Miller, etc.)Longview:Finalized info memorandum - will send out to market later this week.  McCook still interested but slow.  Development is going well but slower than expected.  Viable EPC Contractor is Modern Continental - Karen Barbour from RAC and Jake Thomas visited them in Boston and gained some new respect for their people, experience, approach, credit, etc.  We will likely need a DASH for late July to put deposits down on additional equipment.  I still see this as a Q4 $15MM deal without taking any construction risk.Munis: Mcdonald did a small term deal in NP15 - interestingly it was an index deal through the muni (Shasta) to an industrial (Kanauf) with whom we executed a financial swap - orig approx $400M.Renewables: Air Force deal was booked to Foster because a mid-marketer worked with Elliot to close the deal and also some of the credits we sold had been banked by Foster from last year.   This is OK with me as long as all of the other wind stuff gets properly credited to orig (anything with ENE Wind, Cinergy, enXco, Pacificorp, Montana, putting a site to munis, etc.).  No need to referee!AMPS: We pulled the plug on the Oregon site.  We are about to do the same with the Utah site.  Will continue to support Brett if he needs it.Montana: another meeting went well - we are hiring bond and tax counsel to work on the structure.  Still looks like a $500MM prepay tied to a portfolio of assets and contracts.  Their bid is $40 escalated at cpi for 500MW 7X24 for 10 years starting 7/1/02.  Montana should trade at a discount to Mid-C so this is transactable if we can make the stars line up.   At their request, we are responding to a Montana Power RFP for renewables (Enron Wind has two sites and we are partnering with them in a RFP response).  Chris Calger503-464-3735",0

"Las Vegas:Allegheny's bid was strong but required a financing out for 45 days - unacceptable.  Black Hills' bid has a clean purchase and sale markup with a bid that implies a $35MM gain for ENA ($10MM has to go to Calpers since they are an investor in LV 1).  They are going to their board Thursday and want to execute by early next week and close Aug 31.  We will try to get a higher bid from Northland this week ($40MM gain).  They will require a two-week financing out which they will secure with a $10MM non-refundable deposit.  If we sign with Northland, they can close in July.In either case, accounting may require us to recognize this income this quarter because Las Vegas is a fair market value investment.   RAC requires a DASH to sell an asset of this size - we will circulate on Wednesday or Thursday.One long shot deal we are proposing to Allegheny:  Tear up the existing 15 year toll backed by the Las Vegas project.  Enter into a 15 year firm energy sale from EPMI at Palo Verde.  The value of that deal may be in excess of $100MM since the market has fallen so much.  If we did that, we would have a merchant asset that would have to be sold at or near cost - this is achievable.  This would be significantly riskier than our current plan and would probably require board approval, but the value makes it worth exploring.AMPS:We continue to push Geneva Steel and Oregon Steel for permitting info.  West power markets have fallen further so the economics are marginal at best.  Friday's curves suggested a value of $10MM vs a cost of $17MM.  An imperfect put swaption would cost $4MM, further eroding the value.  I spoke to Brett Wiggs on Friday and forwarded him technical specs and reviewed different deal structures that might work.DWR:They announced Thursday that they have signed more definitive long term deals that they will honor (approx 6,500MW long term).  The non-binding ""agreements in principle"" will be renegotiated because prices have fallen so much.  DWR signed our Master Agreement for short term deals but Tim does not want to execute it because of litigation risk.  We will not do anything with them at this time.Generator Tolls:  Interest has fallen off due to rapid drop in power prices.  We are still talking with 6-7 parties, but I dont think anything will get done soon.  Munis:  Mcdonald got a small term sale done at NP-15 with city of Lassen.  Approx $600K of orig.New Marketing Initiatives:Negotiating 3 generator service agreements.  Mostly small plants coming on line this year.  The entrepreneurs behind these deals are shell shocked by the low prices , but many have already committed capital.  Montana: - State forced divestiture of generation.  Retail load is short starting July 1, 2002.  Governor's office has asked us to bring a 700MW 10 year ""solution"".  They are willing to issue a $500MM bond to prepay and buydown part of the energy.  The basic play is to swap an EPMI Mid-C position for an in-state position from PPL, package that up with some renewables and sell to the state under a prepaid PPA.  Long shot but interesting.CA Industrials:  A group of industrials want to buy up to 800MW NP-15 delivered for 5+ years as part of a negotiated settlement with CA.  Gov Affairs is working on a Core/Non-Core structure with the state that would potentially lead to open access for all industrial load if they pay a big exit fee to cover the stranded costs incurred during the past 12 months.

Attached is their analysis.In this analysis we examined only the executed contracts and NOT the agreements-in principle.  (Only executed contracts were released by the state in the last few weeks.) Also, gas-indexed contracts were examined on their nongas costs only.  Since gas costs are a pass through on some contracts, we excluded them as a conservatism; i.e., we did not ascribe costs to the gas portion of the contracts since they will float with market costs over time.  These contracts were marked to market using current, applicable curves.  Finally we discounted at the LIBOR rate, which is around 4%/year.The stranded cost under these assumptions  is approximately $10 billion.  The spreadsheet shows the overmarket costs by contract.  Note: a negative ""mark-to-market"" equals a positive stranded cost.As before, this analysis is based upon Enron's confidential forward curves.

Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.Fielder is also the point person on ""getting ESPs paid"" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.If you have any questions, let us know.Best,Jeff",0
"During the past few days several people have approached us wondering why we are continuing to do college recruiting and continuing with the floor build out given the state of the company today.  We appreciate people's concerns about adding people and spending money at a time when we ought to be reducing unnecessary expenses.  Let us begin by saying that we share these concerns and are not hiring people or undertaking significant capital expenditures without a great deal of thought.  We would also encourage people to talk to their manager or either of us if you don't understand why we are doing certain things.  In short, we have decided to continue with the college recruiting, although we have not yet decided how many, if any, we will hire.  We have decided to delay the beginning of the floor build out for a couple of weeks.Why Are We Continuing With College Recruiting?During the last few years we have made tremendous progress establishing a presence for Enron broadly and the Portland office specifically with leading schools in the northwest.  This past year we finally reached critical mass and had tremendous success in our recruiting efforts.  Although we are uncertain about our hiring needs this year, we feel that it is in our best long term interest to continue having a presence with the schools in the northwest.  We have already made presentations and done initial screenings at most schools.  We have identified the best people from each school and have already made plans for them to come to our office for two super Saturdays.  The cost to us to finish this process is not large compared to the benefit that we gain from honoring our commitment to the schools and students as participants in their on-campus recruiting programs.  We also realize that it is a hard year to be coming out of school looking for a job.  It is our belief that students would rather interview with us even if the possibilities of employment may be somewhat diminished.  Finally, we would like to emphasize the point that we have not yet committed to hiring anybody.  We will interview people, identify the best candidates, and make hiring decisions based on the needs of the office.  Before extending offers we will consider the potential impact that it could have on people in this office and Enron employees in other offices who have been redeployed.  Stated another way, we don't intend to hire a bunch of new people if there are people within Enron who could fill positions or if it would put the jobs of the people already here at risk.  We may end up postponing hiring decisions until we are more certain about the state of affairs in the company.How Will the Floor Move Play Out?We have decided to postpone the floor build out for a few weeks.  While we still think that it makes sense for the office, we have decided to pause for a couple of weeks before we start to spend significant amounts of money on this.  When talking to the build out team today it became clear that delaying would accomplish several goals.  First, it allows us to get final architectural plans in place and firm quotes from contractors so that we can more precisely peg down the costs before moving forward.  Second, it gives the build out team breathing room to iron out more of the details of the move.  Finally, it buys us a little more time to decide whether or not it makes sense to do this project given the state of affairs of the company right now.  While we still think that we are going to move forward with this project, it seems like buying a couple of weeks of time is the right thing to do right now.  In about two weeks we will reconvene with the build out team with firm budget numbers and make a decision to either move ahead, cancel, or delay again.  As always, we will try to keep people updated on things as soon as new, reliable information becomes available.  We recognize that this is a very hard time for everyone.  Please try to stay focused on the job at hand and keep up the success of this office.Tim Belden and Chris Calger",0

They noticed this and stayed until it was fixed.  It turns out that a DBA somewhere made a change that caused the mapping of our Futures positions to change.  Had this person communicated to people what he/she was doing, it is my understanding that the problem could have been avoided.  Stated another way, lack of communication by someone in technology caused our risk group to work an extra 15 hours on Friday night.  I should add that one or more people in technology had to work extra on Friday as well.It is so frustrating to see this sort of thing happen over and over.  The list of little things that cause lots of extra work is so long that it is not funny.  It kills morale and burns out smart, hard working people.  What do you think we can do to change this situation?",0

(NYSE: DYN) beat expectations in the third quarter, reporting that its earnings rose to $286 million, or 85 cents per diluted share, from $177 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, for the same period in 2000. This represented a 22-percent increase from 3Q 2000 and boosted the company's 2001 earnings estimate. Dynegy has a market capitalization of $14.5 billion. Its stock is currently trading at about $43 down from a 52-week high of $59, although it is important to note that for year-end 2000 the company's stock was one of the top performers among Standard & Poor's 500 companies with a total shareholder return of 218 percent. Dynegy employs 5,778 people. Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) reported $638 million in losses for the third quarter, after taking $1.01 billion in charges associated with several of its non-core businesses. The company's 3Q recurring net income (before the write-offs) increased 35 percent to $393 million, or 43 cents a diluted share, and revenue in the quarter rose to $47.6 billion from $30 billion in 3Q 2000. Enron has a market capitalization of $14.8 billion. Its stock is currently trading at about $16.0, which represents a six-year low for the company and is considerably lower than the peak of $82 hit in August 2000. Enron employs 20,600 people. Analysis: Dynegy closed out a banner year in 2000 and appears to still be on a roll in terms of its financial performance. In contrast, Enron faced an unprecedented year of turmoil, and is presently languishing in a low ebb, characterized by a strategic crossroads and heightened scrutiny of the company's financial reporting. While the two companies operate in the same market space of power trading and are fierce competitors, Dynegy-ironically the younger and smaller of the two companies-is an industry success story while Enron's status remains rather uncertain. The questions to be addressed in this article are: What is Dynegy doing ""right""? What is Enron doing ""wrong""? What lessons can other power and natural-gas marketers learn from this ""tale of two companies""? Although they are often referred to as ""cross-town rivals,"" Dynegy and Enron are worlds apart in terms of their competitive positions. Their divergent approaches to the global marketplace illustrate what could be the single-most important element related to their disparate positions at the end of 2001. Put more simply, the two companies have vastly different strategies, and-hindsight being 20/20-a strong argument can be made that Dynegy's strategy is the winner at this juncture. Throughout this article, I will focus on two key areas in which Dynegy and Enron differ dramatically. Those two key areas are the ownership of physical generation assets and the extent to which the companies have expanded (and invested) into non-core sectors. Both companies started out as natural-gas companies and converged into the power market in the 1990s. However, that is essentially where their similarities end, and over the last few years Enron and Dynegy have followed decidedly different paths. In an attempt to make the complex rather rudimentary, let me summarize the two paths this way: Enron does not believe it needs to own physical assets to be a success in the power and natural-gas trading sector; Dynegy, on the other hand, not only believes in the ownership of physical assets, but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the company as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry. Let's look at the companies separately. We'll discuss Enron first since it is the older of the two. Enron readily admits that its strategy is difficult to define, but a close approximation is that Enron literally creates commodity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers. The participation and success in commodity markets, according to Enron, does not necessitate ownership of physical assets. In fact, the company has routinely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wholesale business. Rather, Enron has concentrated on developing a new philosophy of risk management excellence, in which it will merely buy and sell the commodities it needs to participate in trading venues. As an example, Enron bought Portland General (which owns 2,000 MW of generation and 41,600 kilometers of electric T&D lines) in 1996 as a way to launch its penetration of the West Coast power markets. When competition fizzled in that region, Enron put Portland General back on the sales block (a sale of Portland General to Northwest Natural is pending at this writing). Likewise in Europe, where it is one of the most prominent trading companies, Enron has disposed of generation assets such as Sutton Bridge in England and, unlike other U.S. competitors, has refrained from buying additional generating units in opening countries such as Germany and Italy. According to its most recent 10K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Enron owns or controls 2,015 MW of generating capacity (including joint ownerships), which is drastically lower than the average among other companies operating in the power trading sector. Dynegy's approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different from Enron's. In the words of CEO Chuck Watson, ""Dynegy's long-term strategy is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets, which supports earnings sustainability."" Ever since going public in 1995, Dynegy has been on an acquisition binge, with each purchase significantly increasing its generation capability. Dynegy presently owns or controls about 27,000 MW of generating capacity in the United States, 26 gas-processing plants and 14,000 miles of pipelines, which are located in geographically competitive areas. The company's goal is to own or control 70,000 MW, or 10 percent of the U.S. market, within the next five years. Sometimes, Dynegy has acquired assets through partnerships with other companies such as NRG Energy, but just as often it has purchased assets independently. Most notably, when Dynegy acquired Illinova in early 2000, the purchase doubled Dynegy's generating capacity. Dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in Europe, where it is presently planning to purchase natural-gas storage facilities in England. Dynegy executives have argued that natural-gas storage is the best way to back up a natural-gas trading operation. There's no question that the approach is working. Out of the $286 million that Dynegy reported in the third quarter, $263 million of it came from the company's main wholesale business. The issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference between Enron and Dynegy, and its significance should not be overlooked. It is not difficult to make a case that supports Dynegy's approach. Owning physical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the course of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and anticipate small changes in price. In other words, by controlling the actual output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells, a trader such as Dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be in a particular region, how much power can be produced to meet that load and when shortages might occur. In addition, in markets that are short on infrastructure, it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market unless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region. By the same token, those companies that do control physical assets often have greater communication with grid operators, and possible insight to spreads (the difference between various energy prices). In fact, Dynegy's CEO Watson fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around the volatility of price, and being capable of resolving balances when shortages exist. This may be more difficult for a company such as Enron to accomplish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in power bids. Dynegy's strategy of acquiring both natural-gas pipelines and power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities. On the other side of this argument, a case could be made that Enron's approach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility. Certainly, by investing less in power generation facilities, Enron has less capital on the line when compared to a company like Dynegy. Under a scenario when market prices suddenly drop, a company such as Enron that does not have heavy capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an asset-laden company because Enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixed payments of a generation facility. Asset-heavy companies also may find that their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilities in times of extreme price volatility. As the industry becomes increasingly focused on bottom-line results, this could be seen as a potential concern for investors. Further, some would argue that Enron's approach of establishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell requirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility. What Enron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own portfolio. Consequently, the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the ""great debate"" among power traders. However, although Dynegy's overall performance in the third quarter was better than Enron's, that does not necessarily provide a clear endorsement of Dynegy's strategy toward acquiring new generation facilities. Keep in mind that Enron's 3Q losses resulted primarily from non-recurring charges related to its non-core businesses (broadband and water in particular). Without these charges, Enron's core wholesale trading business continues to perform well. This is a point that CEO Ken Lay has been quick to reiterate to investors. ""Our 26-percent increase in recurring earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural-gas pipelines,"" Lay said. ""The continued excellent prospects in these businesses and Enron's leading market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook."" Moreover, perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets, the key issue that played a role in the current disparity between Dynegy and Enron earnings in the third quarter is the companies' approach to developing new lines of business. Telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point. Enron, which prides itself as usually gaining a first-strike advantage, plunged into the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies. Under the leadership of then-CEO Jeffrey Skilling, Enron sunk large sums of capital into purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would quickly become lucrative. Now Lay admits that the company ""could have gotten into the broadband business with less capital"" and that Enron ""spent too much too soon"" in this sector. Nevertheless, Enron recorded an $80-million non-recurring write-down for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quarter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by reducing future costs in this sector to $40 million a quarter. Dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecom sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared to Enron. Dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom sector, but in the third quarter took a $15-million loss in its broadband business compared to the $80-million loss that Enron reported. However, Dynegy clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities (electricity and natural gas) and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical way that merely supplements its core business. It is also important to note that Enron gained the first-strike advantage when it developed EnronOnline, an electronic trading exchange. In fact, Enron was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space, well ahead of its competitors. Dynegy later followed this trend with creating Dynegydirect. The two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards, but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case Enron was successful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its competitors. The latest available information indicates that EnronOnline has recorded transactions that exceed $590 in notional value. Since its inception in November 2000, Dynegydirect has recorded $33 billion in notional transactions. At this juncture, Dynegy and Enron are very different with regard to their approaches toward financial reporting. Enron, which has often been accused of not providing a balance sheet to investors, is currently struggling from a serious image problem as the Securities and Exchange Commission pursues an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by Enron's CFO. To my recollection, no one has ever accused Dynegy of not providing a balance sheet, and thus the company's status with investors is arguably more solid. As I don't expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy any time soon, my projection is that (at least in the near term), we will continue to see a wide disparity in Wall Street performance between Dynegy and Enron. That is not to say that anyone should count Enron out of the game. As noted, the company's core business of wholesale business remains strong, but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other non-core businesses. That doesn't mean Enron is down permanently, but it will have to find a way to strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and those businesses that former CEO Jeffrey Skilling believed were advantageous. In many ways, the comparison between Dynegy and Enron is rather like the tortoise and the hare parable. I am sure you can guess which company is the tortoise and which is the hare in this analogy. The race between the two is far from over, although Dynegy is taking the lead at this point, based on its more methodical approach. What will be fascinating to observe is how both companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly modify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies.   _____  Correction statement to 10/23 IssueAlert on European trading: According to a news report from Reuters, the U.S.-owned Entergy-Koch Trading was listed as a publicly traded company.

"Last year, Enron employees generously donated a record $2.8 million to the United Way, an amount which exceeded our goal of $2.3 million by nearly half a million dollars.  This year we are setting our sights even higher with a goal of $2.9 million.  When matched dollar for dollar by Enron, our total contribution would be $5.8 million.This goal is a challenging one, but we believe it is achievable with your help.  It is also a far-reaching goal with the United Way touching 1 out of every 2 lives in the greater Houston area.  To kick-off this year's campaign, please join us for the EWS Leadership Giving Reception in the Bluebonnet Ballroom at the Crown Plaza Hotel, 1700 Smith St. on Tuesday, July 31 from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m.  The adopted agency for EWS this year is the Center for the Retarded.  Representatives from the center and recipients of Enron's United Way Scholars program will be there to share their experiences with you.  We will also review the campaign objectives for this year.Given the fact that Enron executives are highly compensated with generous options and bonus programs, we invite you to help by joining us as a member of the Alexis de Tocqueville Society with your generous donation of $10,000 or more to the United Way.  In 2000, Enron was the Society's leader in Houston with 49 members, and we also ranked in the top 25 nationally in total membership.  Your support this year will help Enron to continue as a leader among companies in this distinguished group.Whatever your decision regarding your pledge, we need 100% participation from our executives in order to set a good example for the rest of EWS.  Your contribution to the United Way will continue to make a difference in our community.  When you give, you change a life right here in the Houston area.Please RSVP to Zulie Flores via e-mail at zulie.flores@enron.com or by phone at ext. 3-3908 by Friday, July 27 and join us in setting the standard for EWS by giving generously and getting your pledge in by August 10.Mark and Greg",0

Gen. Bill Lockyer this week suggested the chairman of aHouston-based power company should be locked in a prison cell with anamorous, tattooed inmate named Spike.   Lockyer, who is investigating whether energy firms have manipulatedprices on the wholesale electricity market, made the comment in aninterview with the Wall Street Journal that appeared Tuesday.   ""I would love to personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Layto an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Himy name is Spike, honey,' "" Lockyer said.   Enron spokesman Mark Palmer called the comment ""counterproductiverhetoric"" that ""does not merit a response.""   But other industry representatives denounced the remark as""outrageous,"" especially because neither Lockyer's office nor anyinvestigative panel has filed charges against Enron or other companies.   ""You'd expect that the state's chief legal counsel would file chargesfirst and make public statements second,"" said Gary Ackerman of theWestern Power Trading Forum, an association of energy producers andtraders. ""We're very disappointed with his choice of words, which don'texactly fit the profile of his office.""   In an interview Tuesday, Lockyer said he decided to ""ratchet up"" thecommentary to ""put [energy companies] on notice"" that ""we are not afraidof them and have the will to prosecute.""   ""What I'm trying to do is let these economic buccaneers understandthat if we catch them, they're going to be prosecuted,"" Lockyer said.""Just because they're multimillionaires and run big corporations, itdoesn't provide them with immunity.""   The attorney general is investigating whether power company officialstried to maximize profits through illegal manipulation of prices on thewholesale energy market. Several panels, including a state Senatecommittee and the California Public Utilities Commission, are conductingsimilar probes.   On Tuesday, Lockyer announced that three power companies have agreedto turn over documents subpoenaed months ago by his investigators. Theattorney general went to court to obtain the documents after thecompanies failed to meet a March 19 deadline to hand them over.   Lockyer said the forthcoming documents would help his office as itsifts through mountains of evidence in search of possible violations ofantitrust or unfair business practice laws.   ""Evidence is accumulating that certainly infers illegal activity,""Lockyer said. ""But we need to make sure it's compelling and clear enoughthat you can convince a jury.""   Lockyer said he singled out Enron's chairman because the Houstoncompany is the world's largest energy trader.   At least one observer found Lockyer's comments refreshingly candid.Harry Snyder, a senior advocate of Consumers Union, said, ""Let Lockyer beLockyer.""   *   Times staff writer Dan Morain contributed to this story.Folder Name: Rahil JafryRelevance Score on Scale of 100: 82______________________________________________________________________To review or revise your folder, visit http://www.djinteractive.com or contact Dow Jones Customer Service by e-mail at custom.news@bis.dowjones.com or by phone at 800-369-7466.

I don't think we have met; I work for EPMI in NEPOOL with John Llodra and report to Ed Baughman.  I am writing to ask if you would speak with my brother-in-law, Dave Gautschi, a partner with Deloitte & Touche, who is co-authoring a book on e-businesses called Net Markets (see attached outline and reproduction of the cover).  The focus of the book is to "" ?? take a business executives perspective on the implications of B2B eMarketplaces on their business and overall business environment globally.  It will lead the reader through the basic options for implementing real valuable B2B tools and technologies.  It will then move to more and more complex AND valuable B2B opportunities.  More importantly, it will identify and articulate the day-to-day business IMPLICATIONS of Ebusiness.""Dave, a PhD in mathematics (go figure), a former marketing professor, a folk singer (he leads our family in song fests) and just a great guy is intrigued/impressed with Enron on Line (who isn't) and would very much like your insights.

"So Louise - you are almost as important as Oprah was last year.Does this mean you wil be holding talk shows for troubled traders?M -----Original Message-----From: 	Scrimshaw, Matthew  Sent:	02 October 2001 16:10To:	Kitchen, LouiseCc:	Romano, MarcelloSubject:	Louise Kitchen - Fortune 50 - No.17Marcello finished 5th (out of 30) in the Caterham 7's at Brands Hatch on Sunday so he's famous too now!Carly Fiorina Tops FORTUNE's List of 50 Most Powerful Women in Business for Fourth Year10/01/2001Business Wire(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 1, 2001-- Lower-Profile Women Topple More Well-known Names From Tech andInternet Sector; Ranking Includes 14 Newcomers Though Hewlett-Packard lost $65 billion in market value in a year, CEO Carly Fiorina hasn't lost her nerve, and for the fourth consecutive year holds the No. 1 position on FORTUNE's ranking of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business. The complete list and accompanying stories are in the October 15 issue of FORTUNE, available on newsstands October 8 and at www.fortune.com at 12:00 p.m. on October 1. In the No. 2 spot is eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who runs an Internet company that actually makes money: $85 million in the last four quarters on $582 million in revenue. Oprah Winfrey, the Queen of Media, is mightier than ever, and holds the No. 3 spot, up from No. 15 last year. She produces movies, brings comfort and advice to millions of TV viewers, propels books to bestsellerdom, and, last year, teamed up with Hearst Magazines' Cathie Black (No. 28 on the list) to publish O, The Oprah Magazine-by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever. At No. 4 is Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon, who has breathed life into ailing Avon. Mirant CEO Marce Fuller-the only newcomer in the top five-holds the No. 5 position. Inside a stodgy utility, Southern, Fuller built a high-growth trading and marketing unit, which was spun off in April. In these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap its reward. In FORTUNE's annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly. Says FORTUNE senior writer Pattie Sellers in ""Patient But Not Passive,"" the story that accompanies the list, ""By patience, we mean staying with a company, steadily building influence there, and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge, not promises and self-promotion."" Fiorina, who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNE's inaugural list in 1998, heads the biggest company ($48 billion in revenues last year) run by a woman. And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever. Wall Street practically heckled her latest move-a bold bet to buy Compaq-but Fiorina, 47, remains defiant. In difficult times, ""people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny,"" she says. As always, the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time. Last year, power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that influence was fleeting. Gone from the list this year: Deborah ""Hurricane Debby"" Hopkins, who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May; Ellen Hancock, who failed at the startup, Exodus; and Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker, who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz. But one Web warrior looks better than ever: Meg Whitman, No. 2 on the list. She has never overpromised to investors; instead she has diligently delivered above-target profits every single quarter. Fourteen newcomers join the list this year: Marce Fuller, President & CEO, Mirant; Louise Kitchen, COO, Enron Americas; Colleen Barrett, President & COO, Southwest Airlines; Betsy Bernard, President & CEO, AT&T Consumer; Anne Stevens, VP, North America Vehicle Operations, Ford Motor; Maria Elena Lagomasino, Chairman & CEO, J. P. Morgan Private Bank; Susan Desmond-Hellman, EVP and Chief Medical Officer, Genentech; Janet Robinson, SVP, Newspaper Operations, New York Times Co.; Carol Tomi, EVP and CFO, Home Depot; Carrie Cox, EVP and President, Global Prescriptions, Pharmacia; Carole Black, President and CEO, Lifetime Television Networks; Janet Davidson, Group President, Integrated Network Solutions, Lucent; Larree Renda, EVP, Retail Operations, Safeway; and Louise Francesconi, VP and GM, Missile Systems, Raytheon. While the economy and its points of power change, the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same. Says Sellers: ""We consider the size and importance of a woman's business in the global economy, her clout inside her company, and the arc of her career-where she has been and where she is likely to go. When appropriate, we also weigh the woman's influence on mass culture and society. That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No. 3 on this year's list."" The shifts on our list this year are dramatic, with 14 newcomers. But one trend is especially intriguing: Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever. A few years ago, responsibility for a $3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list. No more. This year's FORTUNE 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $20 billion or more, which is a first. In a related story, ""It Took a Lady To Save Avon,"" Katrina Brooker looks at Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon. Says Brooker, ""Jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them. And that's what has made her one of the most successful CEOs-male or female-in recent years."" Over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way Avon does business: how it advertises, manufactures, packages, and even sells its products, and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated Avon Lady, but by reviving her. The result: growth in revenues, operating profits, and operating margins. In addition, FORTUNE includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business. The top ten, featured in the magazine, are Marjorie Scardino, CEO, Pearson (Britain); Anne Lauvergeon, Chairman, Areva (France); Mary Ma, Senior VP & CFO, Legend (Hong Kong); Marianne Nivert, President & CEO, Telia (Sweden); Lien Siaou-Sze, Vice President, Hewlett-Packard (Hong Kong); Patricia Barbizet, CEO, Artemis (France); Eiko Kono, President, Recruit (Japan): Belinda Stronach, CEO, Magna International (Canada); Marina Berlusconi, Vice Chairman, Fininvest (Italy); Christine Tsung, President & CEO, China Airlines (Taiwan).

"There are two fields of gas that I am having difficulty with in the Unify System.1. Cage Ranch - Since there is no processing agreement that accomodates this gas on King Ranch, it is my understanding  HPL is selling the liquids and King Ranch is re-delivering to stratton.  It is also my understanding that there is a .05 cent fee to deliver this gas.  We need a method to accomodate the volume flow on HPL at meter 415 and 9643.  This gas  will not be reflected on Trans. Usage ticket #123395 and #95394 since it is not being nominated from a   processing agreement.  We either, need to input a point nom (on HPL or KRGP) at these meters to match the nom at meter  9610, or a deal for Purchase and Sale (if King Ranch is taking title to the gas) needs to be input into Sitara at these meters  with the  appropriate rate.  I have currently input a point nom on KRGP to accomodate this flow, so we can  divert some of this gas to the current interstate sales that are being made.2. Forest Oil -   There is a processing agreement that will accomodate flow from the meter (6396) into King Ranch.  It is my understanding that this agreement was originally setup until Texaco had their own processing agreement.  I need   confirmation that the gas from this meter should be nominated on contract # (96006681) and that this agreement should  have been reassigned to HPLC. (It is currently still under HPLR).   If this gas is not nominated on the above transport agreement, then once again we need to accomodate the flow volume  on the HPL pipe with either a point nom or a Sitara Deal at meters 415 and 9643.",0

"We have tentatively reached an arrangement with Duke regarding the repair work.  If closing takes place prior to completion of the repair work, Duke will assume control of the repairs and Enron will continue to pay actual invoices received in connection with the repair work so long as they are consistent with the agreed upon scope of work.Currently the estimated costs are $1.45 Million (these have increased slightly from our prior conversations because of new problems uncovered when the generator was opened up).  We are reasonably certain that no further material problems should arise in the completion of the work and that the estimated cost is reasonable static.On the insurance claim related to this work, I understand that the insurance company is balking at paying two components of the repair work which will likely (if this is their final, unchallenged position) result in the deductible exceeding the loss payable (i.e. no insurance proceeds payable to ENA).Please feel free to call with any questions.Stuart",0

Enron bears this tax obligation under the Sales Agreement pursuant to which we sold the Peakers to Allegheny (effectively, this tax liability is a ""pre-acquisition date"" tax liability that we, as the seller, are responsible for).  Typically, the equipment used to construct the Peakers would be assessed Sales/Use tax when purchased by the Project company that built the respective Peaker and that tax would effectively be passed on to the buyer in a sale such as that to Allegheny.  The EWS Tax Department structured the acquisition of the respective equipment to either avoid the Sales/Use tax or to spread the cost of such tax over time (for example, a sales-leaseback strategy was employed in Illinois to spread the cost of the Sales/Use tax over many years as lease payments are made rather than pay it up front).  Ultimately, we benefitted from this since we did not use as much cash in constructing the Peakers and earned more from the disposition of the Peakers than we otherwise would have since the counterparty would have (and we believe did in the specific case of Allegheny) modelled the cost of the Peakers as including the full current payment of such Sales/Use tax.  That said, we have requested that a portion of the disposition proceeds from the sale of the Peakers be reserved until the applicable statute of limitations related to the types of strategies that were employed to achieve the above described results expires since there is risk that our position could be challenged and, if challenged, there is a risk that we would not prevail.  Matt is out until May 8 (he is a recent father of a baby girl) but upon his return is available with me to discuss this matter with whomever you would like.  Matt has worked closely with Don and others in the Generation Asset group and has assured me that the suggested reserve is a sound (not overly conservative nor liberal) position.  Best regards.  Steve. -----Original Message-----From: 	Kitchen, Louise  Sent:	Monday, April 30, 2001 3:18 PMTo:	Matthew F Gockerman/HOU/ECT@ENRONCc:	Stephen H Douglas/HOU/ECT@ENRON; Don Miller/HOU/ECT@ENRONSubject:	Tax reserve on Allegheny PeakersI notice that our gain has substantially decreased due to a tax reserve increase of $5m.

"Your Invitation to Enron's Executive ForumThe Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate in an Enron Executive Forum.  This invitation is extended to those who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the past few years.  These informal, interactive forums will be approximately 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.  Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although attendance is not mandatory, the forums are designed to address those issues.  They also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to its executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do ""reality checks"", create a ""rallying point"" and ensure Enron's executive management is on the ""same page"" about where Enron is going---and why.We realize that individuals based outside the United States will not want to make a special trip to attend the meeting, but may be able to attend one of the sessions while they are in Houston on other business.  We also hope to schedule a similar session in London later this year.We currently have a session planned for:Wednesday, June 20, 2001 from 3:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Houston, EB50MThe Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here's how it will work:?	Each session will have approximately 25 participants.?	The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue.?	This will be your forum. Don't expect to simply sit and listen to presentations.?	This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own questions and express your own opinions.?	You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum.?	Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not limited to: thedirection of Enron, business goals/results, M&A activities, projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity, values, etc.Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we encourage you to accept this invitation only if you intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to do the same.  We also ask that you refrain from canceling your attendance once enrolled so that we will not have to cancel the forum.  The Office of the Chairman is very willing to take valuable time from their busy schedules to hold these forums.  Enrollments will be on a first come first served basis and we hope you would be able to honor your commitment to attend.  For planning purposes, it is essential that you RSVP no later than Monday, June 11, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586.We will confirm your registration with you, in writing and forward a list of enrollees to the Office of the Chairman.Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson via e-mail (gerry.gibson@enron.com).  Gerry can also be reached at 713.345.6806.  Thank you.",0

"The attached file contains a list of the variables we identified in our August 18th meeting.  I tried to break them down into smaller group just for organizational purposes.  The items under Prices and Temperatures should be easy to gather using the LIM database.  The items in the Other category may require more research.  What we have done in the past if we could not find the exact variable try and fine a proxy for it.  For example it may be difficult to find irrigation usage, but less difficult to find precipitation in a region.  Since these two items would intuitively seem to have an inverse relationship it may be possible to use precipitation as a proxy for irrigation.  After we have begun to research the Other variables we may have to come back to you and discuss proxy variables so keep that in mind.  We added a column for use to keep track of the statues on each variable this is just for us to keep track of where we found the variable or why we did not pursue it.  Let me know if we have missed anything or you have subsequently thought of anything not on the list.",0

Please note that under the transportation section the first subheading is a volume request and the other sub-headings are revenue requests.  We would also like a better understanding of the capacity utilized for each section.  From an operational expense standpoint we need to show the historical breakdown, but going forward we need to assume that TW is a standalone entity.

We also wish  to inform you that AEC has now decided toparticipate in a group that is examining the feasibility of the RubyPipeline, which is being proposed by Colorado Interstate Gas to serve thewestern United States. The proposed Ruby line would have a capacity of 750million cubic feet per day and deliver gas from Wyoming to northernCalifornia with a connection to the Wild Goose storage facility. Theaddition of a large new pipeline in this region would also offer Wild Goosestorage customers a more liquid trading hub in the heart of the volatileCalifornia gas market.

"We'd expected the expansion to actually be in the 200 - 250 MMcf/d range, althoughas intimated in this press release, we might see a follow-on expansion notice for more volumes later.My gut feeling is that they're waiting for more certainty regarding permitting/certification on a coupleof the Bakersfield area IPP projects first before proceeding with the second phase.  The good news is that an expansion on the order they're describing here should not materially affect the overall Western U.S. gas balance with over 6.0 Bcf/d being consumed in California alone.Gas Daily 11-15-00Kern River casts its lot with California expansionLooking to accommodate demand for gas-fired generation in California, Williams has plansunder way to expand its Kern River Gas Transmission system. The company announcedyesterday that it would file an application with FERC to add an additional 124,500 dth/d offirm transportation capacity from Wyoming to California markets.The proposal  called the California Expansion Project  would tap into increased productionin the Rocky Mountain basin. And the California Expansion could pave the way for asecond expansion of Kern River. According to a company release, Williams plans on holdingan open season later this year to gauge interest in additional capacity on the pipeline.A combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas-fired power generationfacilities in California is fueling expansion of the system, said Kirk Morgan, director of businessdevelopment for Kern River and Northwest Pipeline. Kern River is well-positioned topursue an economically attractive expansion of its mainline.The $80 million project proposal calls for adding three new compressor stations, as wellas boosting or retooling existing facilities in Wyoming and Utah. Williams also plans to upgradetwo meter stations. The project,s anticipated in-service date is May 1, 2002.Back in August, Kern River held an open season to determine interest in firm year-roundgas transportation service in Nevada and California and to determine interest for capacity relinquishmentby existing shippers (GD 8/18). The pipeline landed a number of contracts providingfor delivery of Rockies supply into California.According to Williams, demand for new capacity out of Wyoming is being driven by anumber of factors, including a shift in downstream markets for Canadian supply and strongeconomic growth in Kern River,s market areas. Surging demand for gas-fired generation hasalso played a role.Morgan said a ramp-up in Rockies production coupled with demand for competitive transportationpromises a solid base for future expansion.  An expansion on Kern River in 2003could help bring that production to market, he said.The 922-mile Kern River system delivers Rockies and Canadian supply to markets in California,Nevada and Utah.  At present, the system has a design capacity of 700 million cfd.",0

Because the rate was above max, we had to file the deal with FERC.  This was exacerbated by the fact that because of the customer's request for service, we had to ask FERC for a waiver on the ""one day prior notice"" requirement.FERC California Pricing - FERC staff members continue to call for help in understanding transport and commodity prices for gas at the Cal border.  News to us was the fact that FERC has access to EnronOnline but did not understand how to use it.  They are also getting a subscription to Gas Daily.Capacity West - On Thursday 12/21 we did a one day posting for an additional 10,000 MMBtu/d of LFT capacity for January from San Juan to Cal Border.  The current January spread to Needles is $5.40 net of fuel.SouthWest Gas - We met with SWG management last week to discuss the service being provided by TW at their new interconnect.  So far everything is working well, however, SWG is attempting to maximize their flexibility under the OBA agreement and their ability to take swing gas from TW.  Our response has been we will continue to help them when we can within operational limits but we cannot jeopardize the rest of the TW west system.  SWG indicated they would like more information regarding our mainline expansion project; they recently purchased 85,000 MMBtu/d of capacity on the Kern River system.Pogo Producing - Pogo would like to flow gas to TW's West Texas lateral by February 1.  They estimate volume of 20,000 MMBtu/d and have no qualm on the approximately $400,000 interconnect cost.  This is a new well near the recently connected EOG well.  ",0

"Interactive Open Season - TW held its third IOS of the year this week for 14,000 MMBtu/d of space from East of Thoreau to PG&E Topock.  Ten parties originally registered to bid of which 7 actually participated.  The high bid was Reliant at $.138.Gallup Compressor - A meeting was held with Operations, Regulatory, and Facility Planning personnel to review the performance of the new compressor station.  Currently, the vibration level has increased.  The unit and lateral efficiency are a continuing concern.  Operations plans to pull the unit apart in early September for an evaluation.  At this time, the anticipated 30,000 MMBtu/d of ""additional"" capacity we hoped to have is now not available.  There is also concern that we may be unable to meet our currently subscribed FT obligation.El Paso All American - We attended the El Paso Pipeline meeting this week as they described their FERC filing to begin the conversion of the All American Pipeline from oil to gas.  They reiterated several times to attending shippers that the project would not offer any incremental space to the main line.  El Paso's filing centers around the cost and fuel savings from decommissioning very old compressor equipment on their south system and replacing the capacity with the All American line.  The cost figures (conversion and acquisition) that El Paso filed tracked very closely with what Transwestern estimated in its evaluation of the pipe.  The in-service date is expected to be July 1, 2001.Transport Options - TW Commercial reps met with marketing and regulatory personnel from Burlington Resources, Conoco, and Texaco this week to review the proposed Transport Options Tariff filing.  The meeting was very positive and constructive.  Several suggestions were made that led to the realization that the best course of action would be to delay the actual tariff filing and have a working group meeting in the Houston office.  Everyone agreed that as much preliminary work as possible should be done before the filing to make the whole process less contentious and to garner more customer support for the tariff.  We are trying to schedule the working group session for the third week of August.Crawford Lateral - A line leak on the lateral this week reduced flow from 50,000 MMBtu/d to zero.  Operations initially estimated 2-3 days of down time but actually only required 12 hours.  Approximately 55 feet of line was replaced.El Paso Measurement Letter - Stan Horton forwarded the ""mis-measurement"" letter to El Paso management this week.  We will follow up in approximately two weeks if they don't respond sooner.Operator Imbalances - Met with Market Services personnel to review operator imbalances across TW's system.  Marketing is supportive of Gas Control's efforts to limit the imbalances and begin allocations if operators schedule gas and then can't deliver.  With proactive balance management, there is opportunity to realize greater Park 'N Ride revenue.TransColorado Shipper Meeting - Kevin Hyatt will be attending the TransColorado shipper meeting this week in Boulder.  Christine Stokes attended the Colorado Oil & Gas Association meeting.",0
"As a follow-up to our meeting last Friday, I have reviewed the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement (CSA), SoCalGas System Adequacy proceeding testimony of Lad Lorenz and the CPUC Dec. 11, 2001 Decision on Unbundling the SoCalGas system by implementing the CSA with modifications.  I also have a call into Rodger Schwecke at SoCal to discuss their upcoming tariff filing and the related capacity issues.  Some of the pertinent points made in these documents relative to receipt point capacity and allocation are as follows:Comprehensive Settlement AgreementAppendix B outlines the details of backbone transmission/receipt point capacity rights:	1. All receipt points will be defined with firm capacity and primary access rights that reflect physical limitations.  The Appendix B table of receipt point capacity indicates that for No. Needles, Transwestern has Primary Access Rights of 750MMcf/d and Mojave at Hector Road has Secondary Access Rights.2.  For interconnects into SoCalGas with more than one upstream pipeline, secondary access rights will be defined.3.  New or expanded interconnects with existing or new pipelines will have secondary access rights only and will be subject to bumping by gas scheduled through primary access points.  In the text of the CSA, the Open Season procedures for intrastate backbone transmission/receipt point capacity are described in detail.  Briefly, its proposed to work as follows:1.  Initial Reservation for Core customers.  SoCalGas Acquisitions, core transport agents and wholesale customers serving the core will be provided a set aside amount of capacity.  This included 300MMcf/d at North Needles.2.  First Stage/Phase I of the Open Season for 50% of RP capacity after deducting core customer set aside.  Existing noncore customers may bid on any RP capacity up to 100% of their historical usage.3.  Second Stage/Phase II of the Open Season for remainder of Phase I capacity, if any, not awarded or allocated.  Available to same existing noncore customers as in Phase I to bid on in this second round if they haven't been awarded capacity up to their 100% historical usage.4.  Third Stage/Phase III of the Open Season for 50% of RP capacity after deducting core customer set aside plus any remaining capacity not awarded in Phases I and II.  Bidding open to any existing or new customers with creditworthiness established.5.  SoCalGas will hold annual open seasons for expired or non-contracted available capacity.6.  Market concentration limits were set such that no person or entity including affiliates may hold more than 40% of the capacity (after core set aside) at any one receipt point awarded through the open season process.  This does not include secondary market capacity or individually negotiated contracts acquired after the initial open season.Examples of North Needles capacity:	Physical capacity	750 MMcf/d		Add'l 25/50	775/800					Core Cust. set aside	300			Inc. core	313					Avail. Cap. for bidding	450					462/487					Phase I  avail. cap.	225					231/243.5					Phase II avail. cap.	remainder of 225			remainder of													231 or 243.5					Phase III avail. cap. 	225 + remainder 			231/243.5 +								of Phases I & II if any.			remainder of 													Ph. I & II if any.System Adequacy Proceeding--Lorenz TestimonyLad Lorenz testifies that the proposal to allocate firm receipt point capacity on the SoCalGas system is intended to be used ""until the commission acts in the GIR proceeding"".  In Section H. of Lad's testimony on Firm Receipt Point Access, Table II illustrates that North Needles will be expanded by 50MMcf/d to a level of 800.  In Table III under the heading of Firm Primary Access it states ""TW--who then allocates among its shippers"" in reference to the 800MMcf/d of capacity listed for North Needles.In this same Section H, Lad states that this alternative proposal for allocating primary firm capacity at each receipt point will achieve improved reliability ""until the Commission acts to approve the CSA"".CPUC Decision 01-12-018 on SoCalGas UnbundlingThe Commission approved the CSA on Dec. 11, 2001 with certain modifications.  These modifications included:1.  Market concentration limits were decreased from 40% to 30% and included capacity attained in subsequent open seasons or by individually negotiated contracts.  Secondary market capacity remains excluded from the market concentration limit.2.  A secondary market price cap was established at 120% of the interruptible rate ($.07191).3.  Reinstated the core reservation for intrastate capacity at 1044MMcf/d (CSA lowered it to 1000).  This explains why the core reservation for Needles is 313 and doesn't match the TW/SoCal contract level.  The additional 44 was allocated per a Calpine proposal on a prorata basis to each receipt point with Needles receiving an additional 13MMcf/d.In the summary and conclusion sections of the Decision, SoCalGas was directed to include the additional 375MMcf/d of new backbone and receipt point capacity in its open season.  This part of the Order did not provide any direction as to how the new capacity was to be allocated to upstream pipelines.  Additionally SoCalGas was directed to file an advice letter for implementation and to include proposed methods for allocating any additional future capacity additions.",0

"FYI, Kim. -----Original Message-----From: 	Frazier, Perry  Sent:	Thursday, March 07, 2002 2:25 PMTo:	Lebeau, Randy; Watson, Kimberly; Abdmoulaie, MansoorSubject:	RE: Re Ivanhoe E.S.DJust a couple of additional thoughts,  the cost estimate for ESD mods of $130,000 will typically be, about 25% more.  The E&C costs,  company overheads and construction support will increase these costs to around $170,000.  I did talk with Fred this morning and will relay the highlights of our conversation.  The current free flow rates north on this lateral average around 35 - 50 mmcfd.  The gas supply is from the Leedy Plant and various low pressure gathering interconnects.  The gas flows north bypassing the compression unit but utilizing the dehydration unit at Ivanhoe.  The gas end up with NNG on the North side of the lateral,  this Lipscomb lateral is isolated from the TW system at the Canadian River block valve.  The 2 units at Ivanhoe are idle and were designed for higher pressure delivery to NNG.  Since they have not run in some time, its probable to spend an additional $300,000 to activate and upgrade the control panels and end devices.  Then we would most likely have to design and resize the units for an additional guess of $350,000.In order to abandon these units, I would recommend we abandon in place or Plant Held For Future Use.  My guess is about $15 - 25,000 to pull spool pieces and blind flange the units.  I do know that there is some drilling going on in the area,  I don't see a tremendous influx of supply to support the cost to utilize this lateral any different than the current status.Let us know your comments.Perry 3-0667 -----Original Message-----From: 	Lebeau, Randy  Sent:	Thursday, March 07, 2002 11:20 AMTo:	Watson, Kimberly; Abdmoulaie, Mansoor; Frazier, PerrySubject:	FW: Re Ivanhoe E.S.DHere is an estimate for the upgrade to the Ivanhoe ESD system.

"FPL Acquires Entergy    FPL Group will acquire Entergy for about $6.4 billion in stock ina deal that will create the largest US power company. The news sentFPLs shares lower because of disappointment that FPL was not thetakeover target. The combined company will have 6.3 million customersand 48,000 MW of power generating capacity. FPL supplies electricservice to about 3.8 million customers throughout Florida. Entergydelivers electricity to about 2.5 million customers in parts ofTexas, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. The deal, a $27 billionmerger, which included their combined market value of $16.4 billion,$6.9 billion of Entergy debt and $3.8 billion of FPL debt. FPLshareholders will own 57% of the new company and Entergys 43%. Theboard of directors will be made up of 8 FPL members and 7 Entergymembers. To support the deal, FPL and Entergy plan to buy back atotal of $1 billion in stock, $570 million in FPL stock and $430million in Entergy stock. FPL shareholders will receive one share inthe new company for each of FPLs 170.5 million diluted sharesoutstanding. Entergy shareholders would receive 0.585 share in thenew company for each of their 228.1 million diluted sharesoutstanding. Shares of FPL fell more than 8%, to 48-1/4 and Entergyshares fell more than 10% to 27-1/4 yesterday afternoon. Based onFPLs price on Monday morning, the deal values Entergy at about $28.33per share. Many had speculated FPL was to be bought rather than beinvolved in a merger. The merger agreement includes a $200 millionbreak-up fee in case either side terminates the deal. The merger ofFPL and Entergy must be cleared by shareholders as well as federalregulators and was expected to close next year. The combined companyexpects to pay a dividend that is consistent with FPLs currentdividend policy. Based on its current annual dividend of $2.16 pershare, Entergys shareholders would receive $1.26 per share comparedwith its current dividend of $1.20 per share. FPLs Broadhead willbecome the chairman and Entergy Chief Executive Leonard will becomechief executive of the new company. The expected annual cost savingsand increased revenues for both competitive and regulated businessesmay range from $150 million to $275 million, with about half the costsavings to come from work force reductions, mainly through attrition,growth and voluntary retirement.",0

"El Paso, Coastal Consolidate Pipeline StaffEl Paso Energy and Coastal Corp. announced plans yesterday to relocate more than 1,200 employees and retain only satellite offices at the El Paso Natural Gas headquarters in El Paso, TX, and the ANR Pipeline headquarters in Detroit, MI, once their merger is approved by the FTC, which is expected sometime in the fourth quarter. No final decision on staff reductions has been made, an El Paso spokeswoman said. The companies intend consolidate the operations of their five pipeline systems into three organizations, collectively led by John W. Somerhalder II. Under the consolidation plan, the combined company's nationwide pipeline system will be consolidated into three regional operations. The western region will consist of El Paso Natural Gas Company and Colorado Interstate Gas Company and will be headquartered in Colorado Springs, CO. The eastern region will consist of ANR Pipeline and Tennessee Gas Pipeline and will be headquartered in Houston. Southern Natural will make up the southeastern region headquartered in Birmingham, AL. John Somerhalder will continue as the executive vice president of the El Paso Pipeline Group. Patricia A. Shelton, currently president of El Paso Natural Gas, will lead the consolidated western region pipelines. Jay Holm, currently responsible for El Paso's Australian pipeline assets, will return to the United States to become CEO of the eastern region. Reporting to Holm as presidents of Tennessee and ANR will be Stephen C. Beasley and James J. Cleary, respectively. The southeastern region will be led by James C. Yardley, who will continue as president of Southern. Shelton, Holm, and James Yardley will report to Somerhalder. ""This consolidation will create the most effective organization for El Paso's pipeline system,"" said El Paso CEO William A. Wise. ""Our upcoming merger with Coastal will create an interstate transmission system that spans the nation, border to border and coast to coast. This consolidation represents a highly disciplined approach to managing this system, allowing us to strike a proper balance between customer focus and operational efficiency. It also facilitates a company-to-company exchange of expertise across our system and speeds the merging of separate company cultures."" While the companies will be organizationally merged, the five pipeline systems will remain separate with separate tariffs and separate names. Though many back office functions such as accounting and gas control will be consolidated and relocated to the new headquarters, field functions and related activities will remain in their current locations. In addition, some employees will remain in the El Paso and Detroit locations. The company will ask affected employees whether they want to be considered for relocation. Those employees who elect not to relocate will be given severance packages. Most moves will occur during the first half of next year, and the majority of the plan is expected to be implemented by mid-2001. The companies announced their $16 billion polling-of-interests transaction in January (see Daily GPI, Jan. 19). The merger is expected to be accretive to El Paso's earnings per share (EPS) immediately and add more than 5% to EPS in both 2001 and 2002, Wise said at the time of the merger announcement. Overall, the two companies expect $200 million in cost savings. By comparison, the El Paso-Sonat merger created more than $100 million in savings and more than 600 people lost their jobs. The combined interstate transmission system of the new company will consist of over 58,000 miles of pipeline, by far the most of any pipeline company in North America. The system will transport more than 20 Bcf/d of gas through existing pipeline infrastructure, but will have sole or part ownership in three other new or proposed major pipelines, including Alliance, Gulfstream and Independence. The company also will be the second largest gatherer of natural gas in the United States and the third largest U.S. producer of gas. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------",0
"Note:  With Dynegy as anchor, NGPL is planning on building a lateral into St. Louis for the first time.  MRT (a Reliant pipeline)has been the only pipeline into this market.  NGPL Plans Lateral to Serve Illinois Power in St. LouisNatural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) announced plans to build a new 47-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline lateral into St. Louis to serve Illinois Power's gas distribution system. The $35 million project, which is anchored by a contract with Illinois Power affiliate Dynegy Marketing and Trade, will add at least 300,000 Dth/d of gas transportation capacity to the St. Louis market. ""The pipeline project and related agreements ideally demonstrate our ongoing strategy to expand our natural gas pipeline services into growing markets currently not connected to NGPL and to increase throughput on our system by adding electric load to our extensive pipeline network,"" said Richard D. Kinder, CEO of Kinder Morgan Inc., the parent company of NGPL. The new lateral will extend from Centralia, IL, to a point on Illinois Power's gas distribution system in the East St. Louis market. The project is scheduled for completion in June of 2002. NGPL and Dynegy entered into a number of long-term, gas transportation and storage contracts, including a 10-year agreement effective June 1, 2002, which will provide Dynegy with 90,000 Dth/d of gas via the new pipeline. In addition, NGPL and Dynegy entered into various other firm transportation agreements totaling another 98,000 Dth/d of gas sourced from NGPL's Gulf Coast and Amarillo lines beginning as early as Dec. 1, 2000. The NGPL project effectively creates a new supplier for a geographical area that until now has been served by just one natural gas transportation company [Mississippi River Transmission], according to Larry F. Altenbaumer, president of Illinois Power. ""This new connection to Illinois Power's system will help open competitive opportunities to natural gas customers in the metro east area of St. Louis. It not only provides for a new delivery point to service customers directly, but also to fuel electric generation in the area. ""The 10-year agreement to provide firm transportation service to Dynegy provides us a solid anchor customer for the pipeline project,"" said Deb Macdonald, president of NGPL. NGPL intends to solicit expressions of interest from other shippers in December and January. The results of the open season will determine the final scope of the project. ""With Dynegy as our anchor customer, we will build the new lateral into the St. Louis market regardless of whether we receive other expressions of interest,"" said Macdonald. ""We anticipate a strong response, however, given the size of the market and the potential for additional gas-fired power generation."" Interested shippers should contact Mark Menis, NGPL's director of business development, at (630) 691-3347. ",0

"American Electric Power Buys Houston Pipe LineAmerican Electric Power Thursday announced it has made a major move to expand its wholesale natural gas business in the Southwest, agreeing to acquire the 2.4 Bcf/d Houston Pipe Line (HPL) along with the Bammel storage field, one of the largest storage fields in North America, from Enron. AEP said since some details remain to be worked out, it was not disclosing the terms of the transaction at this time. AEP will be acquiring the stock of HPL and it expects to complete the deal in the next couple months. HPL, one of the two original pipelines joined by Enron Chairman Ken Lay to form the company in the mid-1980s, has an extensive 4,400 mile transportation and gathering system through southern Texas. The 118 Bcf Bammel field, located near the Houston Ship Channel market area, has a 65.7 Bcf working gas capacity and is known for its fast in and out capabilities. It has a 1.4 Bcf/d peak withdrawal rate and a 365 MMcf/d injection capacity. ""Adding HPL to our natural gas asset portfolio will help us reach our goal of becoming a top-10 gas trader and marketer,"" said Paul Addis, executive vice president for AEP. The company currently is second in the U.S. in electricity volume. ""HPL will enhance AEP's natural gas business with its multiple connections into the production areas of Texas, its numerous interconnects with intrastate and interstate pipelines and its position in and around Houston as a premier provider of natural gas."" AEP, headquartered in Columbus, OH, has numerous power generation plants in the Midwest and Southwest, including a number of gas-fired plants in Texas. In 1998 it bought the Louisiana Intrastate Gas (LIG) system. John Olson, energy analyst with Sanders, Morris & Mundy in Houston, said ""for 55 years HPL has enjoyed a reputation as one of the strongest pipelines in the country. As a stand-alone operation it is first class. It's a very, very strong asset."" He said HPL has been showing losses of $50 million a year or more in recent years, ""but those numbers are meaningless"" because Enron has been using it at discounted transportation rates to underpin its marketing efforts. Olson said the sale is a continuation of Enron's move to sell most of its hard assets and become a soft asset player. ""They are emphasizing their trading. They are doing far better at trading."" For one Houston-based risk manager, the sale of HPL by Enron was a question of rate of return. The competition among intrastates in Texas is fiercely competitive and for gas delivered to the Houston Ship Channel it can be a game of half-cents, with a shipper on one of the multiple intrastates undercutting another to try to shave a profit, he said. Enron recognized this and wanted out, he speculated. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------",0

"September Forecast---------------------- Forwarded by Lorna Brennan/ET&S/Enron on 08/23/2000 06:52 AM ---------------------------webmaster@cera.com on 08/22/2000 10:28:10 PMTo: Lorna.Brennan@enron.comcc:  Subject: Monthly Briefing: A Shoulder Month Without Shoulder Prices - CERA Alert**********************************************************************CERA Alert: Sent Tue, August 22, 2000**********************************************************************Title: Monthly Briefing: A Shoulder Month Without Shoulder PricesAuthor: Zenker, Snyder, MoritzburkeE-Mail Category: AlertProduct Line: Western Energy ,URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1320 ,Alternate URL: http://www.cera.com/client/ce/alt/082200_18/ce_alt_082200_18_ab.html**********************************************************************As western markets continue to struggle through high August demand and prices for both power and natural gas, September looms as the start of the fall shoulder season. The shoulder season historically has brought the possibility of a break in weather and a demand drop in both power and gas prices from summer levels. CERA expects this shoulder season to differ from years past, however, with power and gas markets producing strong year-over-year prices and little relief from summer levels, even with normal September weather.West-wide power loads will decline but will remain similar to those in June, a month with high power prices. In addition, compared with June levels hydroelectric capacity has dropped owing to reduced stream flows, leaving more expensive gas-fired generation to replace declining hydroelectric output. CERA expects occasional hot weather and higher gas prices to push on-peak prices in the West to 244 percent over September 1999 levels.Continued strong use of gas-fired generation in the West, as well as low US storage inventories and tight supply demand balances, will keep the pressure on gas prices. Topock prices are expected to average $4.45 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in September.These high September gas and power prices are driven by* Declining hydroelectric output. The months of September through November represent the low point for hydroelectric output in the West, with rainfall historically boosting output in December. Approximately 16,400 average megawatts (aMW) will be available from hydroelectric facilities during the three-month period. This represents a net reduction in capacity of 6,900 aMW when compared with the recent June-August summer months and a reduction of 3,600 aMW when compared with September 1999 levels.* Higher, more variable power demand. The Southwest and Southern California still experience hot weather in September, and regional utilities typically consider it possible that a year's peak load event will occur in September. Spiking loads, however, can quickly retreat with a return to cooler weather. Thus, power loads and power prices are expected to experience a high degree of variability during September.* High levels of gas-fired generation. Load growth and a declining hydroelectric resource base will require gas-fired resources to serve approximately the same level of demand as in June 2000, a month with similar average demand and monthly average on-peak power prices in the $150-$178 per megawatt-hour (MWh) range, depending on the region. This strong pull on gas-fired plants will push deep into the generation resource base, driving prices upward. An additional 1.7 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day will be required for gas-fired generators in the US West compared with September 1999 levels.* Strong North American gas prices. Natural gas prices are expected to retain most of this summer's peak levels, as North American supplies remain tight. A market anxious about winter demand and price levels will also limit a price retreat this fall. As a result, average September Henry Hub prices are expected to trade around $3.95 per MMBtu. An active storm season could keep Henry Hub prices near the $4.50 mark.* Strong western basis differentials. The strong demand for gas to serve gas-fired generation and storage concurrently will maintain western basis differentials at high levels, especially in the California markets. CERA expects a Topock-to-Henry Hub differential of $0.40 per MMBtu during September. Extended operational problems associated with El Paso's pipeline rupture would raise that outlook.Regional Power Market DriversHotter-than-normal August weather, transmission and generator outages, high natural gas prices, and declining hydroelectric output all contributed to a rise in power price levels during August. Southern California average power prices in August have thus far exceeded July levels by an average of $90 per MWh during the on-peak period and by $14 per MWh during the off-peak period. Mid-Columbia power prices, bearing the brunt of fire-induced transmission outages, experienced a jump from July price levels of $114 per MWh for the on-peak period and $20 per MWh in the off-peak period.Off-peak prices, which have averaged above $60 per MWh during the June-August period, are clearly defined by the production cost of gas-fired resources. On-peak prices during this same period, at over $100 per MWh in all regions in all months, have reflected a significant premium at times over the cost of the marginal system generator (see Table 1).A return to normal weather should drive West-wide loads down by 8,300 aMW in September from August levels. However, load growth and a return to normal weather are expected to push loads up by 5,400 aMW when compared with September 1999 levels. These greater loads, coupled with a reduction in hydroelectric generation of 3,600 aMW from last September's levels, will create supply tightness during September (see Tables 2 and 3).Hydroelectric, coal, and nuclear generation together will be insufficient to serve West-wide demand in September, even during much of the off-peak periods, requiring gas-fired resources to meet a significant portion of the load. Gas demand for power generation is expected to average 5.2 Bcf per day in September, down from over 5.9 Bcf per day in August but up by a dramatic 1.7 Bcf per day compared with levels in September 1999.September power prices will be defined by a floor set by the incremental cost of gas-fired generation, approximately $50 per MWh, with prices frequently higher as demand increases. As this summer has clearly demonstrated, prices rise in a nonlinear fashion as supplies grow very tight. Hot weather-induced loads should provide additional examples of this relationship. * Cooler- or hotter-than-normal weather in September, coupled with the inherent high variability of September loads, will produce a wide range of price outcomes. Under normal weather, on-peak power prices are expected to fall in the $113-$123 per MWh range, depending on location, representing a 244 percent premium to year-ago September prices (see Figure 1).The latest revision of the California Independent System Operator's (ISO's) imbalance energy market cap down to $250 per MWh is expected to depress market prices during any weather events in September. CERA expects the ISO price cap to limit prices outside of California as well.Pacific NorthwestAlthough demand levels in the Pacific Northwest are expected to retreat in September by at least 1,100 aMW compared with those in the hotter-than-normal month of August, the loss in available capacity from hydroelectric resources will amount to 1,900 aMW over the same period (see Table 4). Thus, the Pacific Northwest will be in an even more limited position to export power to other regions. With transmission interties operating at below rated capacity during this period, power prices in the Pacific Northwest will maintain their tight relationship with those in Northern California. These price levels will continue to support the operation of the region's limited quantity of gas-fired generation. Mid-Columbia on-peak price levels are expected to average $118 per MWh in September.Off-peak power price levels in the Pacific Northwest will also receive a boost from the strong markets to the south. The expected September level of $54 per MWh represents the opportunity cost of power sales in surrounding markets.CaliforniaThe fall months initiate a seasonal shift in price differentials that separates the West into markets that lie north of transmission Path 15 and those to the south. As in years past, hydro-depleted Northern California should experience demand levels that must be served by generation resources within the region. Exports from the Pacific Northwest dwindle, and energy from the nuclear and coal-rich Southwest is constrained from entering Northern California by Path 15 import limitations. This condition, which is expected to persist from September through November, allows Northern California to price at a premium. The expected monthly average on-peak Northern California price of $123 per MWh incorporates this dynamic. Notably, the California ISO is completing a process to remap the zones in California, in part to capture locational price differences more effectively.Southern California, like the Southwest, will typically experience hot weather episodes in September. During these high demand periods, prices will rise to peak levels as experienced this summer. In addition, California as a whole should see average loads in September that are 4,600 aMW higher than those of September 1999. Occasional cooler weather will sharply but temporarily reduce daily prices. Southern California benefits from the abundant export capacity of the Southwest during cooler weather in that region, allowing prices to fall well below those in Northern California. An $8 per MWh differential between the north and south portions of the state is expected, with Southern California on-peak prices averaging $115 per MWh.Off-peak prices of $53 and $47 per MWh for Northern and Southern California, respectively, reflect the continued need for gas-fired resources to support September off-peak loads.Rockies and SouthwestAn extended period of hot weather in July and August has boosted demand in the Rockies, a region with growing saturation of residential air conditioning. Limited transmission capacity and a dearth of cheaper exports from surrounding regions have allowed the Rockies to price temporarily at a premium to all other regions in the West.A return to normal weather in September should restore the previously tight relationship of Rockies prices to those in the North. Rockies prices are expected to fall with loads, with a September monthly on-peak price average of $113 per MWh and an off-peak price average of $43 per MWh.CERA expects Southwest prices to be tightly connected to prices in Southern California on a monthly average basis. The two regions generally experience the same September weather patterns, and a strong 7,600 MW transmission link between the two market centers allows them to balance loads with each other. Strong gas prices and occasional market tightness-induced price run-ups will maintain on-peak prices at the $115 per MWh level in September. Off-peak prices will, like those in Southern California, be buoyed by the high cost of gas-fired generation. A price level of $47 per MWh is expected for off-peak prices.Regional Gas Market DriversThe summer competition for gas supply between power and storage continues in North America, with gas prices reflecting the intensity of that competition. Even as the summer power peak subsides in September across the United States, the need to continue strong storage injections and the threat of storms in the Gulf will keep prices high and volatile. The storage deficit now stands at approximately 350 Bcf, and US storage inventories look likely to head into winter at historically low levels. This critical storage situation will keep prices high despite overall declines in power loads in September. CERA expects a Henry Hub price of $3.95 per MMBtu during September.In the West strong power loads and the potential for power peaks persist through September, especially in California. Overall, total demand for gas is expected to decline across the West from 10.1 Bcf per day during August to 9.8 Bcf per day during September (see Table 5). This load will tend to keep intraregional differentials wide throughout the West during the month. The recent price disconnects between the supply-rich Rocky Mountains and San Juan Basin and demand-charged California will persist. October should bring some change in this dynamic as heating loads in the Rockies begin to increase.In general, winter will bring a dramatic shift in regional pricing differentials throughout the West. The summer pressure on Rocky Mountain supplies caused by high utilization rates on most export pipelines will be relieved somewhat by regional heating loads. Declines in flows into the San Juan Basin from the Rockies will take some downward pressure off prices in the San Juan. On the other hand, healthy California storage inventories should limit price premiums at Topock through the heating season. The start-up of the new Alliance pipeline, which will draw gas to the Midwest, will support prices in the Pacific Northwest and California.CaliforniaTopock continues to be the premium pricing point in North America, although differentials between Southern California and the Henry Hub subsided somewhat from peak levels near $1.00 per MMBtu before this weekend's pipeline explosion. Total imports into California reached record levels during July; total imports of 5.8 Bcf per day eclipsed the previous high by 300 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day (see Table 6). Pipeline capacity into the state during the month ran at 83 percent utilization. So far in August, pipeline capacity utilization is exceeding even that high rate, running at 85 percent. These high rates of capacity utilization are putting pressure on gas prices in Southern California, and the pressure should continue during September.Total demand in California is expected to decline somewhat during September, but continued strong power loads and low seasonal hydroelectric generation will provide support. Total demand in the state should average 6.6 Bcf per day, down only slightly from August's total of 6.8 Bcf per day. Flows into the state between August and September are not likely to change significantly, but price pressure should decline somewhat with demand. The Topock differential to the Henry Hub should average approximately $0.50 per MMBtu for September (see Table 7).Storage inventories in the West are still healthy relative to levels in the rest of the United States, but the storage surplus in the region has eroded. In California, inventories are running lower than last year, and the deficit in the state looks likely to widen during September. The end of injection season storage inventories will determine the vulnerability of Topock differentials to winter price spikes.Pacific NorthwestMalin prices this summer have shown neither the strong premiums that Topock prices have shown nor the wide discounts that supplies in the Rocky Mountains and San Juan Basins have shown. So far this month, prices at Malin are averaging a $0.25 per MMBtu discount to the Henry Hub. Pipeline capacity into the region from the Rocky Mountains is running nearly full; flows on PGT out of Alberta have averaged nearly 2.2 Bcf per day this month. Export capacity out of the region on PGE GT NW is running close to capacity, and pipeline constraints to the south combined with strong California demand are driving the wide Malin-to-Topock differentials.Continuing strong demand in the South will likely keep Topock prices strong, and the wide north-south differentials within the West will likely hold through September. In the Pacific Northwest demand is expected to climb through September to 1.5 Bcf per day from 1.4 Bcf per day in August. This demand level should keep Malin differentials from widening from current levels. For September CERA expects Malin prices to average $0.10 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price.SouthwestPrices in the San Juan Basin this summer have been left behind by rising California demand. Although the westward pull on supplies is strong, bottlenecks between California and the San Juan have led to disconnects between San Juan prices and Topock prices. Pipeline capacity utilization rates on Transwestern and the northern leg of El Paso reached 93 percent during July, with less than 200 MMcf per day of excess pipeline capacity. Increased flows from the Rockies on TransColorado and Northwest are contributing to downward pressure on San Juan Basin supply, and in general, the San Juan has followed Rocky Mountain prices rather than following prices at Topock or the Permian Basin.Unlike in the past two summers, the bottleneck has not allowed power demand on the West Coast to support San Juan prices relative to Permian prices. The differential between San Juan and Permian has averaged $0.50 per MMBtu so far this month and $0.30 per MMBtu since June. Additional imports from the Rockies into the San Juan have increased supply by 200 MMcf per day relative to last summer, but these higher flows do not fully explain the disconnect. Without much change in Southwestern or Rocky Mountains local demand, the San Juan should continue to price at a wide discount during September. The San Juan-to-Henry Hub differential is expected to average $0.60 per MMBtu. As in the Rockies, differentials should narrow substantially in October.Rocky MountainsDownward pressures on Rocky Mountain prices intensified over the past month as utilization rates on pipelines out of the region continued to climb. Record heat and power generation levels have done little to boost gas demand within the region; generation is still largely coal-based, and the demand impact on gas of the additional load is minimal. CERA expects the heavy discount-current Rocky Mountain-to-Henry Hub differentials are around $0.90 per MMBtu-to persist through September. Local area demand is not expected to change during September. Substantial gain in local demand comes in October with heating loads; October demand should average 1.4 Bcf per day, up from August and September averages of around 1.2 Bcf per day.Although the winter heating season will relieve pipeline pressures in the Rockies, winter differentials are expected to stay in the $0.25 to $0.40 per MMBtu range. Strong storage inventories will limit the connection with broader North American markets this summer. Next summer, pressures on Rockies supplies will likely intensify relative to this summer. Although pipeline expansion projects have been announced-Trailblazer and Williams announced expansion plans this summer-the new capacity will not be online to relieve constraints next summer. CERA expects supplies within the Rocky Mountains to increase by 300 MMcf per day next year.Western CanadaAfter widening to over US$1.50 per MMBtu, the AECO-Henry differential has begun to narrow somewhat; maintenance that has restricted flows has largely been responsible for the jump from $0.84 per MMBtu in July. With current supply able to fill the contracted pipe capacity and incremental volumes having to pay full cost to flow, differentials are likely to persist in the mid-US$0.70s per MMBtu for September. AECO is expected to be US$3.25 per MMBtu (C$4.53 per gigajoule) for September. Even with the start-up of the Alliance project, the contract nonrenewal on TransCanada is likely to continue the two-tiered pricing dynamics of contracted versus uncontracted pipeline costs. This will result in differentials that will range between US$0.60 and US$0.75 per MMBtu throughout the winter.Supply build in western Canada continues to languish behind last year's levels. The pace of drilling (over 9,000 gas wells are expected this year) should provide growth in the fourth quarter and into 2001. Supply is expected to be flat with 1999 on an annual basis for this year and up at least 350 MMcf per day in 2001.Sumas prices have been quite volatile, driven by both weather in the Pacific Northwest and maintenance on the Westcoast system. For September, Sumas is expected to be slightly more stable and to price at a modest premium to AECO of US$0.05 per MMBtu.**end**Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated graphic and tables.*********************************************************CERA's Autumn 2000 Roundtable event dates and agendas arenow available at http://www.cera.com/event*******************************************************************************************************************************Account ChangesTo edit your personal account information, including your e-mailaddress, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfmThis electronic message and attachments, if any, contain informationfrom Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

"Note:  This text was released today by Natural Gas Intelligence after an interview with Alliance personnelConstruction Completed on Alliance PipelineThe C$4.6 billion Alliance natural gas and liquids pipeline, designed to transport 1.325 Bcf/d from northeast British Columbia to Chicago, has completed its construction phase and now is commissioning the main line, laterals, compressors and supervisory equipment. The final weld was completed last week near Regina, SK, and Alliance now is injecting linepack. The 1,857 mile mainline is stretched to the Chicago area from northeastern BC. October is still the target month to begin service of the pipeline, which will carry both natural gas and liquids. The pipeline system will transport natural gas through a 36-inch diameter high-pressure line. There will be 14 mainline compressor stations: seven in Canada and seven in the U.S. When it began construction in 1999, Alliance already had commitments from 37 shippers for 15-year contracts worth a total of $8.2 billion.The large volumes of gas Alliance will haul from western Canada into the U.S. Midwest is expected to have a major impact on existing pipelines, markets and prices. TransCanada PipeLines already has filed for new tolls to compensate for customers which have failed to renew firm contracts on its line and instead are routing their gas through Alliance. New gas that makes its way into the Chicago area could be sent on to southern Ontario through the Chicago-to-Dawn Vector Pipeline, scheduled to open in late October with intial capacity of 720 Bcf/d.  The Foothills/Northern Border route from western Canada into the Midwest also is expected to see some slack. Alliance spokesman Jay Godfrey said last month that ""when October comes we won't be in the position that we'll have to start filling the pipe. It essentially already is going to be full."" Connections to 37 gas plants are already complete. Investors in Alliance Pipeline Limited Partnerships include affiliates of Coastal (14.4%), Enbridge (21.4%), Fort Chicago Energy Partners LP (26%), Williams (14.6%) and Westcoast Energy (23.6%). ",0
"Note:   Update on ammonia plant operations.  Check out the economics in the last paragrph.  LBAmmonia Industry Finally Approaches Full Production Plummeting gas prices have prompted a large number of idled ammonia producers to restart operations this month, after lengthy downtime due to last winter's record gas price increases. Houston-based Industrialinfo.com, which tracks manufacturing, said most of the Gulf Coast and Midcontinent plants are at partial or full capacity. An ammonia industry expert at Duke Energy said there has been a 20% increase in ammonia production (222,000 tons of ammonia) since August, representing about 7.6 Bcf of gas demand (34 MMBtu per ton of ammonia). There was a doubling of ammonia productive capacity in Louisiana alone. ""We think just about every plant in the U.S. is back on or in the process of coming back up right now,"" he said. ""Obviously they are not going to be running full out, but every plant is coming back up."" A year ago, ammonia producers were rocked by soaring natural gas prices, which reached $10/MMBtu, up from a historical average of $2. Combined with product overcapacity, the rising costs caused a wave of plant shutdowns across the country. Louisiana was particularly hard hit, with five out of eight ammonia plants idled during the summer. Arkansas, Georgia and Texas were among other ammonia producing states affected. The recent decline in gas prices and inventory, however, has sparked some ammonia producers into ramping up production. Triad Nitrogen and PCS Nitrogen both resumed full production in September at their respective plants in Donaldsonville and Geismar, LA, Industrial Information reported. Terra Industries restarted a Verdigris, OK, plant after an extended shutdown and is expected to bring its Blytheville, AK, plant online sometime this month. Koch Industries and IMC Agrico, with plants in Sterlington, Donaldsonville, Convent and Uncle Sam, LA, are now operating at partial capacity. Other ammonia manufacturers are waiting to see if natural gas prices remain stable before resuming production. DuPont in Beaumont, TX, Borden Chemical in Geismar, LA, and PCS in Augusta, GA, remain idled. ""It looks as if these guys are going to make money running their plants all winter,"" the Duke Energy ammonia industry expert said. ""They are making less and less money as gas prices rise and ammonia prices fall. I see them at the closest to break-even by February where gas is averaging about $2.85. ""Last year the domestic producer margin was only about $3/ton,"" he said. ""They pretty much broke even in terms of gas costs on average. This year they are probably going to make $20-25/ton of production. At $2.80/MMBtu for gas and 34 MMBtu of gas per ton of production, plus $25/ton of additional costs, it will cost them about $120/ton for ammonia production. In New Orleans they will probably cover that for most of the season."" ",0

"GOOD NEWS!!!!!I contacted Schlitterbahn about a two-day ticket for next year and they told me that it is not well advertised but if you want a second-day ticket all you have to do is go to the admissions booth, show them your ticket for the current day or arm band and you will be able to purchase the second-day ticket for:  Adult $16.62, Child $12.07.  This is the only way you can get a reduced ticket for the second day.  Get the second-day ticket as you go in because the admission booth closes at 6 pm.

"As you know, safety is the top priority for ETS. Therefore, when we see incident levels rising in any area involving our employees, company property, the public, or public property, it receives an immediate focus and plan of action. This is the case with the increasing number of vehicle accidents occurring across the ETS operating system.Here are the facts?		To date, there have been 35 Vehicle Accidents experienced during 2001; this number has more than doubled the number reported for the entire year 2000.	?		Seventeen of the 35 Vehicle Accidents this year involved employees backing up and could have been prevented.?	?		Seven of these 35 Vehicle Accidents involved an employee striking a fixed object, each of which also could have been prevented.?	?	This means that 68% of the Vehicle Accidents this year have been preventable. Driver awareness training and continued communications have not had a profound effect on decreasing the number of preventable accidents.?	?	Action Plan?	?	In an effort to decrease the number of preventable accidents, effective immediately:?	?		All vehicle operators are required to use the ""backing-in"" policy when parking, AND conduct a ""Safety Circle Walk"" when leaving a parking space. The only exception would be when ""backing-in"" causes a greater safety concern. Each Operations Team is accountable to see that every team member meets these two requirements.?	?		Each employee involved in a Preventable Vehicle Accident will be required to personally review the details of the accident with the Operation's Regional Director and provide an overview of safe driving techniques at the next Team Safety Meeting. ?	?		Common based objectives for all ETS personnel are being immediately adjusted to include a ""Safe Driving"" component. Preventable accidents may impact the team's performance evaluation and could result in disciplinary action being enforced on the team and/or individual employee.This Action Plan is designed to eliminate the rising number of motor vehicle collisions. It is not put into place to create a burden on anyone, but rather to ensure that all work is performed safely.  Please join me in getting behind this initiative to raise awareness that the safe operation of every vehicle is required and that each employee is responsible for his or her decisions when behind the wheel.REMEMBER:  Safety in Every decision, Believed, Practiced, Promoted and Uncompromised.",0

"Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.

This is still above investment grade.The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, ""Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company.""S&P also said, ""[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales.""As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.

"HOLIDAY SAFETY REMINDERThe holiday season can mean an increased risk of fires and a higher potential for criminal activity due to people taking advantage of convenient downtown shopping and because of the increased number of special events and office parties.  We would like to pass along a few safety and security tips from the City of Houston Fire Department and the Houston Police Department.? Please do not prop open stairwell doors or doors to the freight elevators.  This defeats security. ? Use only artificial trees and greenery in decorating your office space. Do not place cut trees or greenery within the building. Cut trees become major fire hazards when they dry out.? Office parties or the holiday mood may distract you.  Be alert for thieves who try to take advantage of the holiday season. Sometimes just having fewer people at work during the holidays creates an opening for thieves. If you see someone that does not appear to belong in your work area, immediately call the Enron Security Console at 713-853-5360.? Keep your purse or wallet with you at all times or locked away in a drawer or closet.? If you go shopping, invite a friend to go along. Try not to overload yourself with packages.  When you return, lock your gifts away in a safe place.? Always be aware of your surroundings while in a public area. If things don,t look right, follow your instincts and avoid going into the area.? When waiting for a ride home after hours, remain inside the building near a card-reader door until you see your ride arrive. ?

Then enter it into thephone to let them in!  I think I've used it like twice in the year I'velived here!  Anyhow so that's that!To be quite honest with you I was so frazzled that I have no idea what yousaid you needed to do or if you said I could call back after a certain time.My mind was just focused on that code!  I thought I remembered that youcouldn't talk to me the rest of the day.  That's why I didn't call.

"Dear Traders and Schedulers:  The following information is FYI.  Diana Scholtes may have given you this information already, but I just spoke with Corrine at BPA and I think that we can lessen our exposure to hefty charges with the following information:  Please be advised that BPA carries an ""Unauthorized Increase"" charge for the use of transmission that is not properly reserved.  That charge is $12,000.00 PER MW.When calling in for transmission, especially Real-Time, please be careful when using our account numbers, OASIS numbers, and contract numbers.  I suggest that when you use the account number, that you review the structure of the product in that account with the BPA tranny person. (ie- confirm that you are requesting hourly non-firm on the DC Intertie S/N if that is what you intend to reserve.)    Thus far, we have avoided these $12,000.00 charges by splitting some other costs with BPA.  Let's just be careful in the future so that we don't get hit big.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Virginia",0

"Good Afternoon,Short-HistoryIn case you haven't heard, our project to implement a high-bandwidth connection between Houston & Portland and remove our dependence on Terminal Server is a failure.  To make a long story short, the new DS3 allowed more data to travel back and forth but the time to get data between Houston and Portland was 10 times slower than running it through terminal server. Plan B (Thin-Client)So where do we go from here.  We are now starting a process to re-architect our trading applications so that they will run just as fast over our WAN as they do through terminal server.  We will be using an architecture that minimizes the traffic over the WAN, utilizes specialized servers to do most of the processing, and implementing more back-end power.  To help us in the effort, we need your help to identify which applications should be converted first.Good Candidates for ConversionListed below are some attributes for applications well suited for the initial architecture conversion.1.  Runs flaky in Terminal Server (Access Violation errors, application locks-up, etc)2.  Applications primary source of data is located in Houston 3.  Mission Critical time constrained applications4.  Mission Critical poor performing applications5.  Heavily utilized applicationsFeedback from youPlease reply back to the email or stop-by if you have any thoughts on which applications you think should be converted in the first-wave.

Our first game is on Sunday Sept. 9th at Delta Park #8 (NE of Strasser) at 12:15.  All of the rest of the games in the 10 game season will also be at 12:15 and will occur every Sunday between Sept 9th and November 18th with the exception of Sunday October 21st when we have a bye.  We then willhave a Championship game in early December since we will win the league again. Right?  Don't forget to update your player care if you had a recent Birthday orare new to the team.

If this occurs just have the person lift the handset, hear dial tone and dial,  113. This will clear the message waiting light. 2) The message waiting light is not on and you could have a message.

"Mike McDonald and I met with WAPA and the Bureau of Reclamation on Tuesday (7/17) and learned some interesting information about their relationship with PG&E.  On Oct 28th PG&E filed to change the nature of the interconnect and banking agreement with WAPA.  Currently PG&E looks at the imbalance energy (positive or negative) at the end of the month and then figures out what charges are due either party.  The imbalance account is calculated by aggregating MWHrs for the entire month.  As a result, WAPA would have a deficit in the account and then deposit a huge amount of off peak energy to balance out.As of OCt 28th all this changes - WAPA has to submit a balanced schedule on an hourly basis or else be subject to PG&E imbalance prices (which are probably a combination of contracts and spot prices).  I believe this means that WAPA is going to have to be more diligent about its forcasts and more active in the real time and preschedule markets.  We probably need to gear up our relationship with the appropriate people over there to make sure that we are on their phone list.Stewart",0

Just to clarify things, we are settling MPC's Choice customers Energy Imbalance position, and PP&L Montana has the right to any length resulting from MPC's ""domestic"" load Energy Imbalance.  In other words MPC is settling two separate Energy Imbalance accounts, so during the hour they may be turning energy back to PP&L Montana, while at the same time finding themselves short for the Choice loads.  During the recent bullish pricing conditions, Choice customer were leaving themselves long, as of late, MPC is experiencing the Choice customers doing the opposite, positioning themselves short.  The net result is that MPC will most likely be expecting us to fill a short position from this point on, so I'd really like to see what we can do to honor their requests, mindful of the favorable position we've enjoyed over the last several months. Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further, or better yet if you've got a workable solution to the problem.

FOR HOURS IN WHICH ISO DECLARES A SYSTEM EMERGENCY: *	The ISO Real-time Imbalance Energy 10-minute and Hourly Ex Post prices shall be set in accordance with FERC's April 26 Order, as clarified by FERC's June 19 Order. *	The Market Clearing Price (""MCP"") for Ancillary Services shall not exceed the Hourly Ex Post Price for the same hour in accordance with FERC's May 25, 2001 Order, as described in the CAISO Emergency Notice-May 25, 2001 FERC Order On Implementation of the Price Mitigation Plan in April 26 Order. * *	FOR HOURS IN WHICH ISO DOES NOT DECLARE A SYSTEM EMERGENCY: * *	The ISO Real-time Imbalance Energy MCP shall be no greater than 85 percent of the highest Hourly market clearing price established when the last Stage 1 emergency was in effect. *	The ISO Ancillary Services MCP shall be no greater than 85 percent of the maximum Hourly market clearing price established when the last Stage 1 emergency was in effect. * *	APPLICABLE TO ALL HOURS: * *	The system-wide gas price utilized to calculate the Proxy Price mandated by the April 26 Order, as clarified by the June 19, 2001 Order, shall be based on the simple average of the Gas Daily mid-point monthly bid-week SoCalGas large package, Malin, and PG&E Citygate prices.  For June 2001 this average is $9.10/mmBtu. *	The ISO is required to add 10 percent to the MCP paid to generators for all prospective sales in its markets to reflect credit uncertainty. The prices posted on the ISO Web Site do not reflect the 10 percent mark-up. Footnotes: 1 Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are used in the meaning set forth in the Master Definitions Supplement, Appendix A to the ISO Tariff. 2  The ISO is implementing those provisions for which it can make the requisite system changes immediately and will implement the remaining provisions as soon as possible. 3 The maximum MCP for non-emergency hours selling into CAISO markets effective June 21, 2001 and until after the next Stage 1 emergency shall be $91.87, based on the highest hourly MCP during the most recent Stage 1 emergency of $108.08MWh. The ISO continues to assess the June 19, 2001 Order and the steps necessary to implement the Order.

"Gentlemen,Delano is prescheduled to return from their outage beginning HE7 on Monday, 7/23.  However, if you can buy the energy back HE7-10, below $40 (their variable costs), please do so.  If prices warrant, you will purchase 25mw, SP15, HE7-10.  I will tee up Delano for this play, please stay in contact with the control room to let them know what's going on.As far as the price goes, we proposed to Delano that we would split the profit with them.  So, split the delta between what you're able to buy for, and their variable costs ($40).  For example, if you're able to purchase the energy at $30, put in a purchase from whoever at $30, then a sale to Delano at $35 (giving Delano $5, and real-time $5).  The Services Desk (out of the goodness of our hearts), is not going to take anything from this transaction.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We have one more issue with Delano on Monday.  HE23-24 they are prescheduled at 20mw, but they will be able to produce 30mw, so we will possibly have 10mw to sell for them.  They are going to let me know what they want to do.

"According to this article, Morgan Stanley now controls about one-third of the Southern Intertie's total northbound capacity, or about 1,145 megawatts, until February 2002.  Then its share drops to just over 700 megawatts until March 2003.---sch Wall Street joins the energy players By Les Blumenthal Bee Washington Bureau (Published June 9, 2001) WASHINGTON -- Wall Street's interest in the West Coast electricity crisis extends far beyond trading energy futures in some Manhattan skyscraper or arranging financing for much-needed generating plants. Morgan Stanley, which earned more than $5.5 billion last year, has quietly purchased a major share of one of the Bonneville Power Administration's huge transmission lines that link California with the Pacific Northwest. The $18 million deal caught Bonneville off guard and has sparked concern among regional utility executives and lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Morgan Stanley officials said they would use their capacity on the so-called inter-tie to ship power purchased in the Southwest for sale to utilities in Washington state and Oregon. Although most of the attention in the Western power crisis has focused on major energy companies from Texas and other Southern states, Morgan Stanley ranks among the 15 largest power marketers in the nation, according to reports filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Morgan Stanley registered as a power marketer with federal regulators in 1995, the first Wall Street firm to take such a step. Merrill Lynch also is registered with the commission. ""Wall Street firms have long played a role in the trading of commodities, including energy,"" said Judy Hitchen, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman in New York. But many in the utility industry said they hadn't realized Morgan Stanley was buying and selling electricity for actual sale and not just engaging in electronic trading. ""I wasn't aware of it,"" Mark Crisson, superintendent of Tacoma Power, said of Morgan Stanley's purchase of capacity on the inter-tie. ""It shows how things are changing."" And in Congress, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said Morgan Stanley's direct involvement in West Coast electricity markets wasn't all that surprising. ""It's wonderfully lucrative for a few folks,"" DeFazio said. ""This is the big new game. It's the new world of deregulated energy."" Bonneville has four major transmission lines linking California and the Northwest capable of carrying enough electricity to power almost seven cities the size of Seattle. The lines were built by the federal government, are operated by the transmission arm of BPA and soon may be turned over to an independent operator to quiet utility fears that Bonneville could hog the region's power grid. Morgan Stanley now controls about one-third of the lines' total northbound capacity, or about 1,145 megawatts, until February 2002. Then its share drops to just over 700 megawatts until March 2003. BPA and several other utilities own the rest of the capacity. ""They sent us a fax telling us they wanted to buy capacity on such and such a date and ending on such and such a date,"" said Shepard Buchanan, a spokesman for BPA's transmission side. ""No one had ever made a long-term purchase of that (transmission) path before. It had never come up before."" Under federal regulation, BPA had no choice but to accept the Morgan Stanley bid. The transmission lines act like huge spigots that can be turned off and on depending on demand. Though federal regulations prohibit manipulating the lines for profit, theoretically the company that controls the spigot has a huge say in the market. Buchanan said Bonneville would be keeping a close watch on Morgan Stanley. ""We are concerned,"" he said. ""We don't want anyone gaming the market by controlling the (transmission) system. We will keep a close eye on Morgan Stanley and others."" Although not a secret, the deal was finalized in early January and since then has been accompanied by little public notice. ""We purchase transmission capacity from time to time to help us meet our delivery obligations,"" Hitchen said in response to written questions. Morgan Stanley's Internet site and annual report make only passing mention of its power marketing. ""Commodity trading revenues rose 34 percent to a record level in fiscal 2000, primarily driven by higher revenues from certain energy-related products, including electricity, natural gas and crude oil,"" the company's annual report said. ""Increases in energy prices were primarily attributable to strong demand for energy products, relatively low inventory and reduced production values."" Morgan Stanley officials are quick to deny they have any intent to manipulate the market, saying that though it may be required to sell any capacity on the inter-tie it doesn't use to other power marketers, federal regulations prohibit it from making a profit on such sales. ""We have also offered capacity for resale to third parties,"" Hitchen said. Others remain skeptical. Bonneville's power-marketing arm also has expressed unease with the Morgan Stanley contract. Bonneville sells about 45 percent of the wholesale electricity in the Northwest, most of it low-cost hydropower generated at the 29 federal dams on the Columbia and Snake rivers. It also controls about 75 percent of the region's electric transmission grid. Crisson said he also was concerned about a possible conflict of interest because Morgan Stanley and other Wall Street firms help arrange financing for new generating plants. ""It doesn't surprise me a lot that they are marketing power,"" he said. ""They are capitalists. But they need to be careful because they underwrite debt equity for utilities.""    ",0

On June 19, the FERC totally trashed U.S. wholesale electricity markets with price controls and an order for refunds dating back to October or to May 2000 or to whenever they later decide. What is the FERC price cap on electricity throughout the western U.S.? Well, it's whatever the California Independent System Operator decides it is.   Nevertheless, on Wednesday the FERC made a sharp U-turn in the direction of free markets for power. With unquestioning confidence, it ordered all U.S. utilities to consolidate their transmission lines into a few independent transmission operators in order to foster free trade and movement of electricity.   Surely, some might say, the FERC didn't give the California ISO total price discretion over the western U.S., did it? After all, the ISO is simply the administrator of the FERC's very precise formulas, like this one for non-emergencies: the cost of burning natural gas (assuming a power plant is located both in northern California and southern California) at the least efficient generator that was called on in the most expensive hour of the most recent Stage 1 emergency that wasn't a Stage 2 at any point during the hour, plus $6 for operation and maintenance multiplied by 0.85 (then add 10% if the buyer is the California Department of Water Resources).   What could be more clear? More ""market-based,"" as the FERC trumpeted its own ingenuity? How could the ISO possibly manipulate that?   The ISO's initial cap of $92 a megawatt-hour was based on a gas price of $9. After inputting the other elements, that cap turns out to be based on a quite efficient heat rate of 11.4. Surely, the heat rate of the least efficient unit used in the most recent emergency, etc., was 20 or higher.   But the ISO decided it didn't want to pay more than $100/MWh. Who confirms that the ISO really used the correct heat rate? Nobody.   Now, after gas prices crashed to $4, the ISO had full discretion - based on a technicality - to avoid resetting the cap. At all four opportunities, the ISO declined to reset the cap because the ISO staff know they can't get the power California needs for $43, which is where the cap would have come out using the old 11.4 heat rate. That's way below the costs of the marginal generators needed when things get even a little tight.   Sierra Pacific Resources' (SRP) Nevada Power couldn't get all the power it needed July 2 for $92 even.   So, what is the FERC price cap on western power? Whatever the California ISO says it is.   Not surprisingly, Nevada Power and others western utilities are furious with California for successfully using its political muscle to export its problem to the rest of the West.   ""Before the FERC price caps, the market definitely was working. When you had prices of $300 a megawatt-hour, people were mortgaging their restaurants to buy a diesel generator to sell power into the grid,"" said Chelan County Public Utility District's Chuck Berrie, one of a handful of utility veterans in the U.S. who thrived in the deregulated wholesale market. Unlike those of most other western utilities, Chelan's customers haven't seen a rate increase and won't for the next five years, because Berrie and his coworkers have maximized the utility's assets and market opportunities.   ""People were coming out of the woodwork to get generators on line. I've never seen anything like it. But the FERC order killed them,"" Berrie said.   Orders for hundreds of small diesel-fired generators that could have helped get the West through the next 18 months or so were canceled immediately after the FERC order, because the generators cost more than $92/MWh to operate. They are expensive to run, but could have patched over the shortage until big, permanent power plants are finished in 2003. But who wanted to bet in late June that the California ISO would pass up the opportunity for a $44 price cap? So the orders were canceled.   In fact, even with the cap stuck at $92, at least 100 megawatts of installed generators are being taken off line and sent back to the rental companies. When the blackouts come, hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses will be without power that the generators could have provided.   The biggest manufacturer of such generators, Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), said it is redirecting the units to Brazil, which like the western U.S. is highly dependent on hydroelectricity. And Brazil, like the West, is enduring a drought this year. Brazil, however, isn't under FERC jurisdiction.   But surely the generators must not be needed if we are sending them down to poor old Brazil.   Not so, according to utility employees like Berrie, as well as the quasi-governmental Northwest Power Planning Council. The chances of blackouts this summer and winter is still much higher than acceptable, and, of course, higher still without those temporary generators.   Price controls kill the messenger. High prices say that supply should be increased and usage reduced. Really high prices, like those the West has endured for the past year, say ""Hurry!""   But the administration of George W. Bush, after getting a good ol' political whuppin' at the hands of California Gov. Gray Davis, agreed to shoot the messenger.   ""Why would anybody get into this industry with all the uncertainty of this ridiculousness? It's the price caps, as well as the rebates. Or you're going to get sued. Regular people were practically turning over their couches to get the nickels together to invest in a generator, and they have lost their investment,"" Berrie says.   ""I think the horse is dead. Even if you removed the regulations and prices did come back up, people still won't come back. What certainty would you have that they won't change the rules again? Who can take that risk?"" he added.   Yet the FERC just ordered the restructuring of many billions of dollars of transmission lines as the foundation of a free market.   In the East, they must be wondering what that messenger said before the FERC shot him. Apparently it was: ""Brazil's economy can afford to pay more for electricity than the U.S. economy can.""   -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com   (END) Dow Jones Newswires  13-07-01   1821GMT(AP-DJ-07-13-01 1821GMT) ",0
"Spokesman for California's Davis Sells His Shares of Calpine By David Ward  Sacramento, Aug. 2 (Bloomberg) -- A spokesman for California Governor Gray Davis, criticized for owning shares in power generator Calpine Corp., has sold the stock, the governor's office said.  Davis's interim communications director Steve Maviglio sold the 300 shares of Calpine that he had purchased last month, said Deputy Press Secretary Hilary McLean.  Republicans and public-interest groups criticized Maviglio for purchasing the stock while the Davis administration was negotiating long-term energy contracts with Calpine and promoting the company's efforts to build power plants in California.  ``He (Maviglio) felt it was becoming a distraction,'' McLean said.  Maviglio said that he had purchased 300 shares of Calpine at $40 each on June 20, after putting in an order on May 31. He denied any conflict of interest and said the stock was sold earlier this week.  Shares of San Jose, California-based Calpine rose 76 cents to $36.76 in midafternoon trading. They had dropped 9.7 percent from June 20 to yesterday's close.  Maviglio won't be fired or reprimanded for the purchase, McLean said. He won't comment on any conflict-of-interest issues before the administration, she said.  Republicans and public interest groups have criticized Davis after disclosures that some advisers and consultants to the state on energy matters owned shares in companies that are trading electricity or negotiating long-term power contracts with California.  California in January stepped in and began buying power for its two largest utilities, which are insolvent after running up more than $15 billion in debt because of a shortage of power plants and flaws in the state's deregulation law.

"I spoke to Mr. Maldinado this morning and it doesn't look good.  He claims he has a connection to the Minister of ""Energy"" who will allocate gas to him.  I asked where would the gas be delivered, and he said anywhere you want it.  Short term or long term?  Again, anything you want, but probably long term is better.I pointed out that there isn't an Energy Minister in Saudi and would he know the name of the Minister whose giving him the gas?  He stumbled and couldn't remember the name.Finally he said ""What do you have to lose?  Just send me a letter requesting gas with the specs, location and duration"" and he'll do his best to get it.

"HOUSTON ) Enron Broadband Services (EBS), a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. and a leader in the delivery of high-bandwidth application services, announced today content delivery contracts with Road-Show.Com, an online resource for individual investors, and Q4i.com, a financial services provider offering an online broker resource called BrokerIQ.  The two financial services companies will use Enron,s ePoweredv Market Cast and the Enron Intelligent Networkv (EIN) to enhance the quality and speed of content delivery to their investors.  Enron,s solution provides TV-quality streaming video with delivery speeds up to 50 times faster than the public Internet.&These agreements reflect the financial services industry,s need for better and faster delivery of online content,8 said Joe Hirko, co-CEO of Enron Broadband Services.  &The Enron Intelligent Network allows visionary companies like Road-Show.Com and Q4i.com to serve their customers with video to the desktop that has unparalleled speed, clarity and quality.8Road-Show.Com is a fully integrated producer of online streaming media.  The company,s Xvenuev platform offers clients a turn-key solution for personalized live or on-demand webcast communications.  Road-Show.Com broadly streams the presentations that companies typically give on road shows prior to an initial public offering to audiences that include individual and professional investors.&The Enron Intelligent Network and Market Cast technology will allow Road-Show.Com to offer our customers something they have never had access to before ) real-time company presentations and one of the fastest, richest viewing experiences possible.  This will enhance their ability to make fully educated investment decisions,8 said Trey Fecteau, president of Road-Show.Com. Q4i.com provides &one-stop8 advanced technology solutions for financial services companies and their clients.  With its flagship product, BrokerIQv, professional brokers and their firms have a complete broker management system at their fingertips.  Q4i.com will utilize EBS to distribute financial video clips to clients via its BrokerCityv product.  In addition, Enron will deliver Q4i.com,s live and on-demand streaming video clips of golf resorts, golf courses, golf real estate, equipment and golf travel for Internet users around the world through GolfTVv, Q4i.com,s online video network.&Our clients now have streaming video features available on their desktops via Enron,s network,8 said J. Frederic Storaska, chairman and co-CEO of Q4i.com.  &They not only will enjoy on-demand streaming video of financial and golf information, but they,ll have the opportunity to take advantage of special vacation and equipment offers reserved exclusively for our broker-dealers.8Enron,s ePowered Market Cast SolutionePowered Market Cast, an application of the Enron Intelligent Network, is an end-to-end streaming media solution for banks, brokerages and other financial services firms.  Using ePowered Market Cast, companies can enhance investor relations, conduct virtual road shows and stream analyst presentations from their websites.  In addition, ePowered Market Cast is a powerful intranet solution for providing real-time financial news, data feeds, training and presentations to an internal audience.  The application streams video at an average bit-rate speed of 200 kilobits per second (kbps).The Enron Intelligent Network is based on distributed server architecture, a pure Internet Protocol (IP) platform and embedded software intelligence that sets it apart from other networks.  The EIN,s enhanced performance is due to its ability to deliver streaming media content &one hop8 away from the user at the closest EIN edge server.  The result is a TV-quality viewing experience for the user.  In contrast, the public Internet,s ability to deliver the broadband content businesses need is often hampered by packet loss, interference and other disruptions that slow down transmission speed and compromise the end user,s experience.About Enron Broadband ServicesEnron Broadband Services, formerly Enron Communications, Inc., is a leading provider of high quality, broadband Internet content and applications.  The company,s business model combines the power of the Enron Intelligent Network, Enron,s Broadband Operating System, bandwidth trading and intermediation services, and high-bandwidth applications, to fundamentally improve the experience and functionality of the Internet. Enron introduces its Broadband Operating System to allow application developers to dynamically provision bandwidth on demand for the end-to-end quality of service necessary to deliver broadband content.

"PLEASE USE THE POSITION MANAGER HOME BUTTON.When using the SITARA Position Manager,  and you drill down to view details or change the dates, the Position Manager keepsall your views running in the background.  This feature allows you to use the BACK and FORWARD buttons to keep your views running.On the downside, if you keep these views running but do not really intend to go BACK to look at them, the system and your PC are working harderto keep all the old views active and updated.  The HOME button sends you back to your default view - the first view you had up when you hit apply.  By clicking this button, yourPosition Manager will clear out the old views the next time you drill in.   This is the only way to clear out the old views that you no longer need. If you do not use the HOME key, and keep drilling in and changing the dates, the Position Manager is still keeping all the your views for the day running in the backgound.     What we have found is by the end of the day, a user that does not clear out the old views can have well over 30 views open, which is like having30 Position Managers up on your PC.  When that user closes down, the position gets locked up for a while as it tries to clear out all the old views.We will be making some changes soon to that should resolve this issue as far as the SITARA machine is concerned; however, your PC may still be slow with excessive unneccessary views open.   We could make a change to limit the number of active views you can have open, but at this timeI am not sure that is necessary; regardless, in the mean time, please remember to use your HOME button.Other helpful hints - Did you know you can shrink you tool bar?  Tools options - uncheck show tool bar text labels - Did you know you can split your position screen to have pipes on top and zones and meters below? Tools Options - show drill down second panel - If you have an OMICRON POSITION porfolio - your MIN/MAX button shows you ACTUAL - and MIN/MAX for your day swing deals.Same works for NOM FLEX portfolio.",0

"Daren:I am taking over the Duke account from Katherine and am having trouble with 8/00 production.  It looks like we have some spot deals included in the exchange deal 157288.  I think days 9 - 31, which are priced at GD - 0.10, need to be moved to a new ticket if they are spot.   Let me know if you agree.  Also, can you confirm for me that days 8/5 and 8/6 are suppose to be exchange?  The sale volume for those two days was zero, so there was no exchange.  We have not received any statements from Duke yet, so there is nothing to verify our volumes.You may also want to look at Sept. 2000 for deal 157288.  It looks like spot deals are being included in the exchange deal.  Those will need to be moved to a new ticket if they are spot.Thanks,Megan",0

"Good afternoon!No, this isn't a new tip - just a follow-up on the one I sent thismorning. I received some good responses and wanted to pass a couple of them along.Kevin wrote to say that this tip works like a charm, except for one thing:he's had trouble with the router bit not being perfectly centered on thebase, so his dadoes have ended up less than perfect. I referred to thisbriefly at the end of the tip, but here's a quick solution for avoidingthe problem.Before routing the dado in the gauge, first mark a point on the base ofyour router. (I simply add a piece of masking tape since it's easy tosee.) Then when routing the gauge (and later, the panel), always keepthis mark against the straightedge. Your dadoes should be right on.Another email came in from Mike, who suggested making two alignmentgauges. Then you can clamp one at each end of the workpiece before youclamp the straightedge fence down. This prevents the ""wiggling"" thatoften occurs when one end is clamped before the other. Great tip!A big thanks to all who have been sending in suggestions. It's great tohear that so many people are enjoying the tips.Talk to you again in a few weeks.Jon GarbisonOn-line EditorWoodsmithVisit our other woodworking and home improvement sites:100+ Woodworking Plans:  http://www.PlansNOW.com/Woodsmith Magazine:      http://www.Woodsmith.com/ShopNotes Magazine:      http://www.ShopNotes.com/Workbench Magazine:      http://www.WorkbenchMagazine.com/Kits, Jigs, Tools, Project Plans: http://www.WoodsmithStore.com/Back Issues:             http://www.BackIssueStore.com/Woodworking Forums:      http://www.Forums.WoodNet.net/-------------------------------------------------------TO CHANGE YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS or resubscribe, sign up again at        http://www.WoodworkingTips.com/TO UNSUBSCRIBE, send EMPTY email message to:       leave-woodtips-30771C@listserv.augusthome.comNOTE: Your subscribed email address is       dfarmer@ect.enron.com",0
"Hey--Just thought I'd let you know that Lacy went to school this morning-pale & not feeling well--stomach still hurts, but she went ahead.  She's stressing me out big time.  She acted like she couldn't hardly move, but I came back in the house & she was talking fine on the telephone.  But I ask her questions about how she feels & she is just about dead.  I don't know about her.  But she looked pale.  Blood sugar was a little low this morning.  I woke her up at 2 & had her check it & it was good. So I got a little more rest.  I don't think she even woke up enough to remember it.  I don't think the little job is good for her if she's gonna catch everything they have.  She's so careless about washing hands after handling all those nasty little kids & then bites her nails.  Not good!  Anyway, I'm stressed big time over her & over her driving the car. And missing so much school.  I wasn't going to take her to the dr. yesterday because she was better so I figured it was a virus, b!ut she had to have a note from a doctor or she's gonna have to make up school on Saturday & they've threatened to fine me. So I had to pay $30 for them to tell me that she had a virus & missed a day of work.  Oh, well, life is fun.  Anyway, I need to quit gettin down over such trivial things cause there's so many with worse problems to face. I am thankful that the burdens are so light.  But you can still pray for us.  And encourage Lacy to work at Splash Town! Ha!Remind me to tell you about the terroristic  threat at High School.  Another high stress time!  Can't wait until this weekend to see all my cousins & ya'll.  Kiss my grandsons for me.  Love ya",0

Pybus krpybus@bizjournals.comTo: Recipient List Suppressed:;Sent: Wednesday, November 15, 2000 9:28 AMSubject: Fwd: GOP Action Plan: WHAT YOU CAN DO! I got this from Paul Sperry at WorldNetDaily  I don't know who Joe Morris is, but this sounds like a plan! (Note that this has been circulating since last Thursday.)   ---------------------------------------- United Republican Fund of Illinois Chicago  November 9, 2000  From: Joseph A. Morris, President To: URF Leaders and Friends  Herewith is some practical advice on action that every citizen can take in the event that the Florida recount confirms the election of George Bush, but Al Gore fails to concede.  We all know what is going on in Florida, and that the election hinges on the outcome. I am writing you today to prepare us all for what we will have to do if what I think is going to happen actually does.  The recount, which will be finished by 5 p.m. Thursday, will likely show Bush to be the winner once again, with only a few thousand overseas ballots to be counted. Those ballots will be overwhelmingly for Bush, a minimum of 60% and probably closer to 75%. If the count goes our way tomorrow, we have won this election.  This is when something critical happens. Either Gore bows out gracefully or he doesn't, and I can almost guarantee he won't. These are people wedded to power who will only go down kicking and screaming. They will use every legal maneuver in the book to steal the election. (In 1960, when Richard Nixon had every right and reason to challenge the election results he didn't for the sake of the country. Expect no such noble behavior this time.)  What will they try? One bet is to find a friendly judge to throw out the Florida results on a flimsy premise. They are already floating this as a trial balloon in the form of the allegedly ""confusing"" ballots in Palm Beach County. I have seen the ballots - they are not confusing in the least. Indeed, they are identical in form to the punch-card ballots used in Chicago and Cook County, Illinois, in this very election. What is more, it is just as likely that Palm Beach County voters who wanted to vote for Bush inadvertently voted for Nader. All parties approved the form of ballot before the election. The form-of-ballot issue is a mere pretext for an effort a judicial invalidation of the Florida election.  While I hope this scenario doesn't come to pass, I fear that it will, and it will only have disastrous results for the country. The election fight could drag on for months and actually be decided by a court! If this comes to pass the vision of our Founders and the blood of patriots will have been betrayed.  Personally, I am not going to stand for this, and I hope you won't either. The good news is that we are not without voice.  HERE IS WHAT MUST BE DONE: if the vote count affirms Bush's election, we allow a short grace period to see the reaction of the Gore camp. If they have not graciously conceded after a few hours, we must bombard the news media and our public officials AT EVERY LEVEL with phone calls of outrage that demand Gore's concession. I mean literally millions of phone calls. We must jam their phone banks with calls.There are millions of us so it shouldn't be too difficult. (While you're at it, send e-mails to your local newspapers as well.)  If it becomes widely reported - and it will - that there is a groundswell demanding that Gore back down and not embarrass the country, it will be very difficult for Gore to withstand the pressure. He will have to relent.  Here are some places to start:  The White House: telephone (202) 456-4114 FAX:(202)456-2461 e-mail president@whitehouse.gov  The Vice President's Office: telephone:(202) 274-5000 FAX:(202) 456-2883 e-mail vice.president@whitehouse.gov  Vice President's Senate Office: telephone: (202) 224-2424  Senator Tom Daschle (Senate Democratic Leader): (202) 224-2321 Also: (202) 224-5556  Representative Dick Gephardt (House Democratic Leader): (202) 225-2671 Also: (202) 225--0100  Also, be sure to call your congressmen and both your senators. All these numbers are easily located on voter.com. You can also contact them through the U.S. Capitol Switchboard:  U.S. Capitol Switchboard (all Senators and Representatives): (202) 224-3121  Another office to call is that of Chicago's Mayor Richard M. Daley (the brother of Gore's campaign manager, Bill Daley): Telephone: (312) 744-3300  FAX: (312) 744-2324  If you've never made a call like this, there's no reason to be shy. They get opinion calls all the time and are set up to take them. In fact they like calls. It helps them tell which way the wind is blowing.

"Daren,Thinking about Robert's little memo yesterday and along the lines of pulling the marketing (Sitara) function back to your side of the fence I think a strong case could be made in favor of that idea.It is obvious that several people are involved in changing tickets, pathing, nominating, and confirming the Industrials. This dissipates the knowledge base and the responsibility factor. It is a ""Who's on First"" issue.If the responsibility to ensure pricing, volume, and accomplishment of market intent is accurately depicted, and in Sitara, is in your shop then the schedulers could concentrate on the accuracy and correctness of Unify and POPS. I'm sure this would help volume management and client services immensely.As the skill level rises in this area you could then gradually feed more and more of the marketing function (Sitara) to the scheduling group in the hopes they would then have a better understanding of the overhaul picture.I believe the current situation is too much, too fast, for scheduling to handle all at once. It has also created a situation where Robert seems to think not only that he has all the segments mastered, but that he is the only person that should be involved in the Industrials.I will support whatever direction you want to go on this issue, but if you and Pat leave things the way they are please explain to both Robert and Pat that others may be involved in the Industrial activity and that is quite alright.Once again, thanks for listening.Ken - att1.htm",0

"Daren,I have no problem sticking around with the group, it is a compliment and I am glad that you all appreciate what I have been able to contribute to the group.  I just want your opinion on something.One of my many goals while a part of the analyst program is to become a  senior analyst or third year analyst.  It is a promotion that also brings with it a bit of a pay increase.  In no way do I want to imply greed, or that I will only stay for money, but if in your opinion I may be deserving of this, then maybe we could run it by Bob or the program, or whoever is in control of that.

I was out last week.  The rate ($.04/mmbtu) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant.  The fee will be adjusted yearly based on CPI.Bob - I could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the delivered volumes (actuals or nominations).  I think we should use actuals due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a daily basis.  We would receive the estimates/actuals on a lag and may have to purchase gas to offset the imbalance, even though the plant kept the noms at the 45,000 base.  I also think that if the plant does increase the nom, they are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less.

If we're extremely efficient/lucky in receiving data from D&B or Experian, she might be able to begin analysis on that for the private model efforts.I would recommend she plan on coming out for 2 weeks starting the week of 30 Apr perhaps.  Depending on the progress with the private firm data sources, it probably makes sense to send her back to Houston to work on calibration sets with a likely return visit to London as required.Please let me know your thoughts.Cheers,ScottEmbedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)",0

The object of these standards is to set out the best practices of the Global Counterparty group for all locations (Houston, Calgary, London, Southern Cone).We are seeking your input to ensure that the Standards properly reflect a London GCP perspective.  We - Bill Hare, James Scribner and myself - have compiled a draft of the Standards which is attached below.It's important to note that the Standards detail some procedures we have always carried out, and some that we are working towards.  The intention of setting Fundamental Operating Standards is to agree on and document common objectives for GCP.   With this in mind, we look forward to receiving your comments on and suggestions for the draft.If you have any questions please phone me on the numbers below.Regards,KathrynPh: 8345 9336 (tie line)or 001 713 345 9336",0

"BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSEnron Industrial MarketsEnron Industrial Markets has recently completed the first transaction for a new 60-day fixed price product for the lumber industry. Available for delivery in Houston and Dallas, the product is offered by Enron in the over-the-counter market and via Clickpaper.com, Enron,s Internet-based transaction system dedicated to the forest products industry. The first transaction was completed via Clickpaper.com on March 14 with a major lumber buyer in the southern United States. This represents the first online fixed price transaction contract in the industry. With the growing volatility in the lumber industry, the availability of a long-term fixed price product provides companies with another opportunity to mitigate their exposure. Additionally, this transaction represents the convergence of Enron,s increasing involvement in physical lumber transactions with our recognized expertise in financial risk management.In addition, EIM has announced that it has completed its acquisition of the Quebec City, Canada newsprint mill and related assets from Daishowa Forest Products Ltd. In July 2000, Enron purchased Garden State Paper, a recycled newsprint mill located in Garfield, NJ. The acquisition of the Daishowa mill now positions Enron as the seventh largest producer of newsprint in North America. The Daishowa mill in Quebec City will now be called Papiers Stadacona. The new name has great historical significance to the local community in Quebec City. When Jacques Cartier first explored the mouth of the St. Charles River in 1535, the aboriginal people living there referred to the village as Stadacona. This is now the site of modern-day Quebec City. Enron Freight MarketsIn March, Enron Freight Markets (EFM) completed the acquisition of Webmodal, Inc to help launch the traditional intermediary transportation business.  EFM also started its spot trading business and completed 981 transactions in its first month.East Power OriginationOn Tuesday, April 3, the St. Lucie County Commission voted 3-2 to approve the Midway Energy Center near Fort Pierce, Florida, which is a 510 megawatt peaking power plant.  Next steps for this facility include receiving a water permit from the South Florida Water Management District and an Environmental Resource Permit (ERP) from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.Enron CanadaKen Lay addressed a breakfast meeting of the Toronto Board of Trade on Wednesday, April 4, as part of the ""Power Breakfast Series"".

Before his speech, the chairman of the Board of Trade commented that ""this was the best attendance ever"" at one of their breakfast meetings.  After the meeting, Mr. Lay spoke with reporters from Reuters, the Globe and Mail, the National Post, and Report on Business TV emphasizing Enron's commitment to deregulation of the Ontario power market.IN THE NEWSJAPAN: Enron presents power plant plan to Japan governmentTOKYO, U.S.-based Enron Corp on Wednesday presented plans to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) fired power plant in northern Japan, aiming to become the first foreign company to build such a plant in Japan.

Jeffrey Skilling told an audience of about 400 business people at a downtown hotel that California ""has given the term deregulation a terrible name.""  Electric deregulation in Texas officially starts Jan. 1. ""In Texas, I think we've got a pretty good system,"" he said. In San Francisco on Tuesday, the California Public Utilities Commission unanimously approved electricity rate increases of up to 46 percent to try to head off blackouts this summer by keeping the state's two biggest utilities from going under.  When California officials set up deregulation they allowed the price of wholesale electricity to rise but capped the amount companies could charge customers, Skilling said. SoCal Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric say they have lost more than $13 billion since last summer because they haven't been able to pass on the high cost of wholesale electricity. Skilling said Texans are in a much better position and shouldn't worry that their state's deregulation would be like the California experience.  ""California, they just put together a crazy system,8 he said in his first public comments since becoming the Houston-based company's chief executive officer in February. ""The markets in California are the most regulated markets in North America today. And that's what is causing the problem.""    03/27/2001  Associated Press Newswires   Copyright 2001.

In November 2000, the Government lifted its stricter power consents policy, which placed restrictions on the development of new gas-fired power stations, and Enron is now concluding the consultation process for the applicationAs part of the process, updated environmental information has been submitted to the Department of Trade and Industry and a team from Enron will be presenting the plans to Blaenau Gwent Council on March 26. This will be followed by a three-day public exhibition in the local community.Enron expects to receive a decision later in the year.European Economic Summit: Acceleration DirectivesOn March 23 and 24 the European Economic Council Summit will take place in Stockholm.  At this summit the European Commission will present to the heads of the Member States a legislative proposal for a Directive and a Regulation that the Commission adopted on March 13 to speed up the completion of the internal electricity and gas markets.Enron issued a statement to the media on the evening of Wednesday 21st March stating that it specifically endorses the following initiatives incorporated in the text of the adopted proposal:Legal unbundling of the transmission and distribution networks as a realistic solution, ensuring the independence of transmission and distribution system operators. Mandatory appointment of independent regulators in each country with the obligation to fix or approve transmission tariffs before they come into force.The current timetable proposed by the Commission: market opening for electricity in 2003 and for gas in 2004 (industrial, commercial and wholesale customers); and for supplies to all consumers including households by 2005.  The setting of rules in the Regulation for how power transmission tariffs can be charged for cross-border transactions and how congestion and capacity allocation at borders within the EU should be managed by transmission system operators.Enron concludes that it is encouraged by the efforts of the Commission to accelerate the European electricity and gas market opening and the reinforcement of third party rights of access to transmission networks. The Commission's approach of harmonizing both the timetable and the regulatory framework deserves support from all Member States.

As you know, I had invited onefinance professor to our class on Arundel, but he was out of town.  I doplan to invite Sheridan Titman to discuss the issue of using the optionmodels in situations where there is no underlying security that is traded.I do think it is important to face that issue, which is actually covered ata theoretical level in our last couple of readings. The issue of volatility is also an excellent issue for furtherdiscussion, as you suggest.  So far, we've been looking at cases wherevolatility is ""given"".  The problem of finding an ""objective"" measure ofvolatility for a project reminds me of the problem of finding the correctrisk adjusted discount rate, which is not surprising since the concepts arealmost two sides of the same plate.  One approach, of course, is to do somemodeling using traditional decision analysis tools, including subjectiveprobabilities, but the finance people who write options articles don't liketo think  about such ideas. I'll try to address these issues in more detail as the semestercontinues.  I think it was important to surface some of these points early,and to come back to them after we have seen how to apply the methods in anaive sort of way. Thanks for the feedback and comments.

I also realize thatrightly so, real-world application of this type of analysis without a robustunderstanding of finance may degenerate into a succession of assumptionsthatresult in a ""house of cards"" effect.  My opinion at this point is that twoissues are of potentially ""make-or-brake"" importance if I am to persuade mysuperiors to accept these methods for valuations outside the realm ofprojectswhose value is primarily driven by the value of commodities backed byfinancialinstruments.  These issues are easy to guess:1)  Discounting and Risk Free rates:  I do not sense that anyone in theclasshas put forth convincing arguments as to the proper application of timevaluequestions in the absence of liquidity.  Is there someone within the financedepartment that can present a firmer position on this question?2)  Volatility: I found Winston's examples on this metric succinct.  I wouldrecommend that in future years you dedicate some hours of class time to thissubject.  My criticism again relates to messy problems.  I anticipateargumentsagainst real option applications based on the dispute of volatilitymeasures.If I were a conservative financial manager, I would argue that:*** Two-a: implied volatility derived from an industry specific slice ofequityoptions is a shotgun approach -- the projects being valued are of a tranchewhich may in fact have a significantly different outcome variance than theweighted average measured by the equities utilized.  Oil, gas and electrictyaregood examples the major players are competing on many different levels ofthevalue chain. Smaller companies do exist which are dedicated to one strata,butwhat about projects that want to exploit opportunies across strata in avertically integrated company?*** Two-b: based on the following skepticism - if a real option value isbeingproposed for a new business venture (some new unexploited opportunity,)there issome paradox embedded in the increased value based on high volatility in newventures and the high risk of failure.  This skepticism is likely to be lessacute in high-tech sectors where the huge upside of new ventures is paradedbefore us daily by NASDQ touts.  It is a much harder sell to ""mature""industries.Of particular interest in the power industry are investments centered aroundopportunities arising from restructuring of electricity and natural gassectorsas regulation is removed.  A large proportion of the risk is embedded inongoingchanges of public policy on an international basis.  As an intentionallyscrewed-up example, can anyone other than a financial genius correctly assesvolatility for U.S. companies investing in seed projects in Mexico based onspeculation of the inevitable dismantling of the national utility (CFE) andPEMEX?James S.

"Dear Vince: I spent a little bit longer putting together my initial thoughts ondetermining discount rates than I originally anticipated.  It is somewhatsurprising, but there really isn't much academic work that I am aware ofthat addresses these issues.Very briefly,1. I think we need to come up with a way to define the concept of riskcapital simultaneously with the appropriate discount rate.2. I think it is important to model Enron's opportunity cost of capital andhow that changes over time.  The liquidity of a project will affect itsvalue in a very significant way when the opportunity cost of capitalchanges over time.  There is also likely to be a relation between durationand discount rates that depends on the factors generating Enron'sopportunity cost of capital.3. I have vague ideas about possible simulations that may help us quantifysome of the issues that I have raised.Please take a look at the attached document.  You might find this somewhatconfusing, so I will give you a call later in the week to discuss this.Please let me know when you will be free.

"Dear all:A few words about Tom.  He is a power engineer type who has previously worked at northwestern US and New Zealand utilities on various projects including asset planning and hydro scheduling.  He was hired by EI Structuring to oversee modeling efforts using SDDP, Henwood, etc. Because of the recent implosion at EI APACHE, Tom's group has effectively evaporated, and thus he is looking for a new home. He has some  finance background  from having to do  asset evaluation for utility rate filings.  He has almost no options experience.  He seems to have quite a bit of experience in some classes of OR problems.  Clearly the most obvious fit is with my group, but the idea is for you all to see if Tom has a tool set that may be of use to other research projects.  And, as usual, the personality fit is the other aspect to examine.This is meant to be casual. If the consensus is positive, then I will explore the formalities of such a transfer.Thanks,Grant.",0

"Norma,I fully concur. What can we do about it? Can we change the job classification retroactively?Vince---------------------- Forwarded by Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 12/12/2000 02:41 PM ---------------------------   			From:  Mike A Roberts                           12/09/2000 10:33 AM	To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Stephen BennettStephen Bennett, professional meteorologist, was hired into the Research group in September of this year as a Specialist based on salary alignment criteria.  In retrospect, and upon review, he should have been hired on as a Senior Specialist.After coming on board. it rapidly became apparent that Stephen was clearly an ""under hire.""  He is well-deserving of an immediate promotion (really more of a correction) and pay raise, to be made retroactive at least to the 1st of this month. This memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive ""promotion.""At the time of the interview process, there was no position in Enron designated as ""Professional Meteorologist.""  In fact, the most recent similar hire prior to that date was Jose Marquez, also a professional meteorologist, who was hired in, based on salary alignment criteria, as a manager.  While functionally, both these men are meteorologists, Enron has no such job classification. Compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional professional expertise in short time order, it was difficult to peg the proper Enron classification appropriate for this new position.  This original uncertainty and resulting misplacement of Stephen into the Specialist category, rather than the Senior Specialist category, needs to be corrected at this time.Although a ""new-hire"" to Enron, Stephen Bennett has extensive work experience.  He has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the Weather Services Corporation in Boston and at The Weather Channel in Atlanta.  He came to Enron well-referenced by both those organizations, needing no further training and only minimal supervision.Once aboard here in Houston, Stephen immediately demonstrated the core Enron values with our unique sense of urgency.  After only a week, he assumed responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather briefings to the gas traders.  This includes analysis and report preparation as well as presentation.  Also in the presentation arena, he now regularly briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day.  Stephen is a master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous.Stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self-initiative.  He designed, implemented, and now maintains several sub-sites on the Research web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific: the weather derivatives team, the agricultural team, and most recently, the crude and liquids team.  I have recently assigned Stephen to spearhead our conversion and major upgrade of this web page.These above described accomplishments are above and beyond Stephen,s regular duties which include starting work at 5 am daily, reliably and without fail, to assemble and prepare our trader,s weather report.  Recently, with the advent of extended hours for both NYMEX and EnronOnline, Stephen voluntarily on his own accord, assists in our new Sunday weather support effort.  As his supervisor, fully cognizant of his already standard 50+ hour work week, I do not solicit, but readily accept, this above and beyond expectations assistance.In review, the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was Enron,s immediate need for a non-standard, fairly unique professional - a meteorologist, coupled with Stephen,s desire to work for our company in spite of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional title reflecting his chosen career path..  Once hired, Stephen has clearly demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well-deserving of this immediate and retroactive promotion.",0

"Vince,We would like to continue to receive the IIF service for a cost to the Research Group of $15,000 per annum.  Can I ask you to approve this charge?

Our contract with them has expired and we are currently negotiating for more users to have access.  Our current contract is for $50K or $10K per user per year.  We can charge $10K back to you.On the IIF front, the invoice for $47K is due at the end of the month.  Here I would propose that we pay two thirds (to cover our costs and the costs of our Competitive Analysis colleagues in London), leaving $15K for you to cover.Since we took on these services last year, we have expanded our range of sources and projects and are consequently trying to do more with less. Thus I need to allocate some of our costs from OxAn and IIF to other projects.Let me know what you think about this proposal.  Maureen, congratulations on your secondment to Enron Metals (Gwyn mentioned it to me).  FYI, our colleague Jim Roth is providing Competitive Analysis support to Joe Gold and John Sherriff on that project from London.RJ",0

"Dear everyone, We understand the as members of Enron Research group, all of us are working on very interesting projects, some of which are ground-breaking, and we all keep a very keen mind on any development of new technology.  We also find out, through our own experience, that at this age of information explosion, it becomes more and more difficult to have enough time and energy to keep abreast with most of the exciting stuff taking place in this department, let alone in the industry.  It is also our personal experience that many a project we are working on has partially been attempted by other members of this group. As a remedy, we propose that the research group start an informal brown bag lunch group meeting, once every two weeks on Friday, for about 50 minutes.  It is hoped that it will provide a forum for us to facilitate with new technology and development, as well as with each other,s work, so that we do not have to reinvent the wheels.  We envision the following: In this meeting (or seminar), each one of us will take turns to make presentations to the group. The topics could range from theoretical consideration to practical implementation, be it option pricing, process modelling, insurance issue, or Monte Carlo simulation, or anything one finds fascinating.  The presentation material could be papers you have been reading recently, projects you are working on,  some problem that bothers you, or an idea that is fascinating. You  choose your own presentation style.  It could be  everything-you-always-wanted-to-know-but-were-afraid-to-ask, hand waving style, or it can involve nitty-gritty, detailed derivations, anyway a style that suits you and the topic.  Or it can simply be a dry-run for your presentation at the next Risk Conference.  Zimin and Alex will take upon the responsibility of organizing the seminar. We hope the seminar will be up and running in two-three weeks. For that purpose your support will be greatly appreciated. Please let either Zimin or Alex know if you are interested in giving a presentation to the group and provide a tentative schedule. Surely the rest of the group will be happy to hear your presentation. We encourage everyone to participate this brown bag meeting, either to give a talk or just sit in. Zimin LuAlex Huang",0

What I mean is a phone similar to the one in the RAC morning meetings which have several remote speakers going out from the main phone (do you understand what I mean?). If this is done, we would  hear everyone around the table, not just those seated close to the phone.

While the date of my request is later than I would have wished, the reason is that I had originally planned to go back to Turkey this summer and get my mandatory military duty done. However, I now realize I can put it off to a further date. That left me wondering if you believe there is a project that I can get involved in this summer and be useful. If that were the case, I would be more than happy to postpone my military duty and spend the summer with the research group. I discussed this with Dr. Ronn, and he is very supportive of this idea.

Though the controversial multinational has denied plans to sell its stake in Dabhol Power Company (DPC), informed sources say that it has sent feelers to China Light & Power and others to offload its majority holding.Getting out of India may be the best course for Enron. Though it has threatened a fight and invoked political force majeure, the Energy Review Committee headed by Madhav Godbole will certainly weaken its case. The committee points out that the many ""infirmities"" in the DPC approval process brings into question the ""propriety of the decisions"". It is clear that the $20m that Enron spent on educating India's policy-makers and bureaucrats did not even teach them the basics of techno-economic appraisal or due procedure with regard to large international contracts. The committee says it is ""troubled with the failure of governance that seems to have characterised almost every step of the decision making process on matters relating to DPC. The failure of governance has been broad, across different governments at different points of time, at both the state and the central level, and across different agencies associated with examining the project and at both the administrative and political levels. It strains belief to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to execute assigned responsibilities is purely co-incidental"".Though the committee decided that it is not the proper forum to investigate these infirmities, its two key members, Mr Godbole, and former secretary in the Ministry of Finance, EAS Sarma, have asked for a judicial inquiry into the process of clearing the DPC project. Other members felt a judicial inquiry would delay the negotiation process and ""not serve any purpose"". There may be some merit in an argument against a further delay in renegotiating tariffs or facilitating Enron's exit, but the report certainly provides the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) with all the grounds that it needs to start an investigation.CVC N Vittal has already received innumerable requests to investigate the deal, especially the beneficiaries of its education campaign. Though the political establishment may be reluctant to set up a judicial inquiry, the CVC can establish whether there are lapses on the part of ""government functionaries including political executives"" and ensure ""appropriate action"" against them. If it is indeed able to establish ""undue influence"" in signing the contract, then Maharashtra may be able to get out of a deal patently against the public interest without any monetary liability.The Godbole committee has vindicated the stand of anti-Enron activists who have been opposed it since negotiations began in 1994. It establishes that Enron power is expensive per se, and the project needs to be re-negotiated, regardless of the causes for the Maharashtra State Electricity Board's (MSEB) financial distress. Also that DPC's extortionate tariffs are not merely because of the steep rise in petro-product prices and rupee depreciation, but mainly on account of its sweetheart deal with the state government. Enron's contract is clearly one-sided; it deliberately uses expensive raw material (ignoring World Bank warnings), has worked on fanciful demand-supply estimates and several legal requirements and permissions.In fact, the committee has found that the MSEB has been paying Enron Rs 930 crore more than it should every year. This comprises overcharging of Rs 253 crore on account of the large regassification plant of which only 42 per cent of the capacity is used for DPC. There's also a Rs 100 crore extra billing to the MSEB for shipping and harbour charges although the cost of these facilities had been included in the capital recovery charge. By charging more than twice the operations & maintenance rate stipulated by the government of India, Enron collects approximately Rs 246 crore extra every year. It has also been collecting Rs 332 crore every year through inflated fuel consumption claims. Enron has been charging at 1878 kcal/kwh under the power purchase agreement (PPA) although the equipment manufacturer has guaranteed it a much lower consumption rate. This gives it a fat fuel arbitrage opportunity at the cost of the people of Maharashtra. The committee has also pointed to the strange practice of using four different exchange rates for different aspects of the project negotiation: a rate of Rs 32 per dollar was assumed for calculating debt service of rupee loans, Rs 34.5 per dollar as reference rate for Phase-I, Rs 39.35 per dollar as reference rate for Phase-II and a curious Rs 42 per dollar for calculating Government of India tariff. Forcing a reduction of these excessive charges has nothing to do with contract cancellation. All it needs is tough negotiation and public pressure on the political establishment. The Godbole committee has established that DPC's tariffs can easily be halved if excess payments are eliminated and unfair conditions such as the dollarisation of payments, the take-or-pay clause and escrow facility (which is in fact hampering MSEB's reform particularly in power distribution) are scrapped.The security of future payments to DPC under the restructured tariff would be based on increased cash flows from a reformed distribution system. The committee also gives Enron a difficult escape route. It says that if the multinational finds the conditions for restructuring too onerous, it should free MSEB from its contractual obligations and find buyers outside Maharashtra. The committee has tried to establish another precedent on all projects negotiated by government: ""The public has a right to know what is being contracted on their behalf"" and has recommended that all documents, including contracts related to all Independent Power Projects (IPPs), particularly DPC, should be published by the Maharashtra government within two months.Also, having established that demand-supply estimates by the state government were fanciful, the committee has asked MSEB to defer all negotiations with power producers until demand levels in the state permit full absorption of power generation from such IPPs. It recommends that such negotiations should be in accordance with the least-cost plan spelt out by the report. This should also end the hectic lobbying by Reliance (Patalganga), Mittals (Bhadravati), the BSES (Saphale) and others to set up IPPs in Maharashtra.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, April 23, 2001    DPC board set to authorise president, Enron MD to issue notice of termination, Sanjay Jog   Scrapping of Power Purchase AgreementThe board of directors of Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which has already taken an aggressive posture, has proposed to authorise the Enron India managing director K Wade Cline and DPC president and chief executive officer Neil McGregor to issue notices for the termination of power purchase agreement (PPA) and transfer of Dabhol project in view of continuing default by the state and Central governments and Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB).The board of directors, which would meet on April 25 in London, also plans to appoint Mr Cline as its ""true and lawful Attorney-in-fact"" and authorise him to represent the company in the negotiation of all project contracts and financing agreements and their amendments and modifications.Top sources told The Financial Express that DPC would authorise Mr Cline and/or Mr McGregor to serve the preliminary termination notices and transfer notices to the state and Central governments and MSEB under clause 17 and schedule 11 of the PPA.""In response to the continuing default by the MSEB of its payment obligations under the PPA, the failure of the Government of Maharashtra to honour obligations under its guarantee and state support agreement and failure of the Government of India to honour obligations under its counter guarantee, the company has sought recourse to dispute resolution and has initiated conciliation and arbitration proceedings,"" the company resolution said. ""Consistent with this recourse to contractual remedies, the company now seeks the authority to serve preliminary termination notices and transfer notices pursuant to clause 17 and schedule 11 of the PPA from time to time and at any time upon the occurrence of an event giving rise to its right to serve such notices as determined by the company,"" the resolution added.According to the resolution, the directors, the company secretary and officers of the company and each of them acting individually, are authorised and empowered to execute and deliver such documents and instruments and take such other actions as they deem fit to effect the purpose of the resolution, in the name and for and on behalf of the company. Against this backdrop, the state government and MSEB have been exploring the possibilities of issuing termination notice to the DPC for its failure to meet the contractual obligations under the PPA. The state government and MSEB sources said that such a notice could be served by the MSEB as DPC has not paid the rebate (penalty) of Rs 409 crore for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power on January 28 and February 13.The state government and MSEB, which reviewed its position on Saturday at a meeting convened by the Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, are of the view that they have a strong case and substantial grounds to slap the termination notice to the DPC. The DPC's move to appoint Mr K Wade Cline as its ""true and lawful Attorney-in-fact"" deserves importance especially when the state government proposes to set up a negotiating committee to cut the per unit cost and gauge the possibility of sale of Dabhol power to the power deficit states.Mr Cline would also be authorised to dispose of equipment that is worn out or obsolete or other equipment or fuel no longer expected to be used in the ordinary course in amounts exceeding Rs 64 crore or the equivalent in foreign currency in any financial year. Furthermore, Mr Cline would be in a position to enter into contracts and take any other actions for purpose relating to the day-to-day operation of the company's business or exercise its rights and discharge its obligations under the project contracts and the financing agreements----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------BUSINESS STANDARD, Monday, April 23, 2001DPC seeks OK to exit power project , Tamal Bandyopadhyay & S Ravindran The Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) is seeking the approval of its 25 lenders to pull the plug on the $3 billion power project in Maharashtra tomorrow (April 23).The meeting has been convened in London at the initiative of the company. The meeting is crucial as the DPC board is meeting on April 25 in London to discuss the issue of serving a termination notice to the Maharshtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). DPC cannot go ahead with this unless it gets the go ahead from the lenders. While bankers said the lenders' meeting is about the second phase of the project, which is still under construction, state government officials clarified that since there is only one PPA covering both phases of the project, the lenders' decision will be applicable to the existing Phase I also. The second phase of the project involves 1,444 MW generation capacity, whereas Phase I of 740 MW is already operational.""According to the loan agreement, even if only four per cent of the lenders agree to terminate the contract then DPC can do so,"" highly placed sources in the lenders' consortium said from London. This in effect means that only one lender has to agree for DPC to serve a preliminary termination notice.Following the notice, there is a cooling off period of six months for both parties (the MSEB and DPC) to find a mutually acceptable solution, which may take the form of a re-negotiated PPA, sources added. Sources also said that there are two separate meetings scheduled with lenders. The Monday meeting will be attended by all the lenders including multilateral funding agencies like Japanese Exim Bank and OPIC. The second round of meetings schedule for Tuesday will be only with the global loan arrangers ANZ Investment Bank, CSFB, ABN -AMRO, Citibank and the State Bank of India (SBI).Two representatives each from the Indian lenders, IDBI, ICICI and SBI have already left for London. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------AFTERNOON, April 23, 2001Enron winding up operations in India? Marred by controversies since inception, the US-based energy major Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) board will meet this Wednesday, April 25, in London to decide the fate of its 2,184 MW project in Dabhol, including winding up of its operations. ""The top most item on the agenda is to empower DPC Managing Director Neil McGregor to wind up operations in the country,"" state government sources told PTI on Saturday. When contacted, DPC spokesperson declined to comment on the agenda of the London meeting and added, ""I will not like to comment on speculations."" Sources said a team comprising three top officials of Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) including chairman Vinay Bansal would attend the high-profile board meet. Bansal told PTI that MSEB has decided to give a ""fitting reply"" and present its case concerning the Rs. 401 crore penalty that the loss-making board slapped on DPC on February 28, for not generating required power within the stipulated time as per the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). This London meet comes two days after the international and domestic financial institutions sit together (April 23) to discuss DPC's future course of action in the wake of non-payment of dues to the tune of Rs. 223 crore by MSEB and also to take into account the aforesaid penalty.Over the payment of dues of December 2000 and January of Rs. 102 crore and Rs. 111 crore respectively, sources said, both the state government and MSEB had offered to make a ""protest"" payment as per the PPA, but DPC, India's first fasttrack power project, refused to accept on that condition. Currently, Enron India holds 65 per cent in the US $900 million DPC project, which includes MSEB's 15 per cent while General Electric and Bechtel hold 10 per cent each. The controversial ""now on now off"" project began in 1992 but ran into rough weather after the Shiv Sena-BJP came to power and was scrapped only to be revived after renegotiating the PPA. Fresh trouble arose in October last when MSEB began defaulting over the ""enormous"" billing following which DPC invoked the state and centre's counter guarantee and also recently sent three international arbitration notices and invoked the political ""forced majeure"" implying inability to conform towards any financial commitment. DPC had yesterday stated that it had no plans to reduce its stake below 50 per cent but according to Enron Corp's Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling the company would be interested in talking to potential buyers for its stake. Skilling, according to an international financial daily, said the multinational continues to see strong growth in North America, Europe and Australia indicating a possibility of exiting from India----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Monday, April 23, 2001State for consolidating all DPC arbitration notices, Sanjay Jog   The Maharashtra government has decided to appeal to the Centre for consolidating all arbitration notices served DPC for the ""continuous default of contractual obligations"" and name a common arbitrator for the state government, the Centre and MSEB.The Maharashtra government team led by the chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, at its meeting with the union finance minister Yashwant Sinha and union power minister Suresh Prabhu on Monday, also proposes for the appointment of a non-Indian arbitrator with a view to cutting the cost substantially.During arbitration proceedings initiated by the DPC after the repudiation of Dabhol phase-I by the previous Shiv Sena-BJP government in 1995, a non-Indian arbitrator, Mr Kumara Swami was appointed as an arbitrator after a suggestion by a senior counsel Fali Nariman. State government sources told The Financial Express that it would write a letter to the DPC regarding arbitration proceedings after Monday's meetings. The state advocate general Goolam Wahanwati will be suggesting a suitable arbitrator for the state and central government and MSEB. The advocate general will also suggest solicitors and Queens Counsel, who may be engaged in London for this purpose. Incidentally, Mr Prabhu, who was present at the ""janata darbar"" organised by the Thane branch of Shiv Sena, told reporters that the Centre would provide necessary assistance to the Maharashtra government to find a solution to the Dabhol imbroglio.Furthermore, the state government would formally appeal to the Centre to nominate its representative on the proposed committee to negotiate with the DPC in a serious bid to reduce the per unit cost and assess the possibility of sale of Dabhol power to deficit states. The government has suggested the names of Housing Finance Development Corporation chairman Deepak Parekh and former union energy secretary EAS Sarma, who were members of the Godbole energy review committee. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Monday, April 23, 2001 Maharashtra to set up experts panel on Enron   IN order to resolve the imbroglio over payment crisis between the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and US energy major Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company, Maharashtra will set up an expert committee for negotiations even as the multinational is contemplating winding up of its operations in the country. ""We are now going for negotiations and will form an experts committee in which Maharashtra expects the Centre to participate,"" chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh told reporters after attending a condolence meeting to pay tributes to late Nasscom president Dewang Mehta here on Sunday. ""All the four parties -- namely the state, Union government, Enron and MSEB -- should come together for negotiations; otherwise it cannot be a complete exercise,"" he added. Deshmukh and the MSEB team are scheduled to meet Union finance minister Yashwant Sinha and power minister Suresh Prabhu on Monday in New Delhi to discuss the stalemate and find a acceptable solution for the same. ""I am meeting Sinha and Prabhu to request them to take an initiative and send representatives for the negotiations committee,"" he said. Deshmukh's meeting with the Centre comes at a crucial stage as DPC's lenders would be meeting in London, on the same day, to decide upon the future finances of the controversy marred 2,184-mw project in Dabhol. Moreover, the DPC board is also scheduled to meet on April 25 in London to decide the fate of its $900 million project in Dabhol, including winding up of its operations. The meeting would discuss the topmost item on the agenda, which was to empower DPC managing director Neil McGregor to wind up operations in the country. DPC has already slapped one conciliation notice on the Centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non-payment of dues amounting to Rs 213 crore plus interest towards the bills due for the months of December 2000 and January 2001. Asked whether the Centre had send any feel over a possible clubbing together of the arbitration and conciliation processes, Deshmukh replied in the negative. Deshmukh said MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal along with two senior officials would attend DPC's board meeting in London. Bansal had said on Sunday that MSEB would present its case concerning the Rs 401-crore penalty that the loss-making board slapped on DPC on February 28, for not generating required power within the stipulated time as per the PPA. Currently, Enron India holds 65 per cent in the $900-million DPC project, which includes MSEB's 15 per cent, while General Electric and Bechtel hold 10 per cent each. (PTI) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE ECONOMIC TIMES, April 23, 2001  'Enron is a national problem' UNION power minister Suresh Prabhu on Sunday said the Centre would render all possible help to resolve the Enron crisis faced by Maharashtra which is ""haunting the entire country"". Prabhu said he would meet the state chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh in New Delhi tomorrow to discuss stalemate over the payments due to the US energy major-promoted Dhabol Power Company by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. Referring to Godbole committee report's finding that DPC was keen on offering MSEB's 15 per cent stake to the National Thermal Power Corporation, Prabhu said: ""The Centre has not received any such proposal regarding participation of the central power utility."" (PTI) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------AFTERNOON, April 23, 2001 CM takes Enron to Delhi today  Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh will discuss the Enron imbroglio with Union Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha and Union Power Minister Suresh Prabhu in Delhi today. He will request the Centre to appoint a representative to the committee that the state government is setting up to carry on discussions and negotiations regarding the Dabhol Power Project of the US-based Enron Power Company. Today, a special meeting of representatives of all those finanicial institutions which have extended loans to the Dabhol Power Project is also being held in London. A meeting of its directors will be held on Wednesday to discuss the fate of the $900 million project which has been under a cloud ever since its inception. Yesterday, Mr. Prabhu declared at a 'Janata Darbar' in Thane that the Centre would extend all help to solve the Enron crisis. This is in the backdrop of pending bills to the tune of Rs. 213 crore which the state fowarded to the Centre against payments for the months of December 2000 and January 2001. Confirming that there was no proposal from the state government to handover the project to the Centre, Mr. Prabhu said that the situation of the electricity boards in the country was precarious. The Centre had decided to assist Maharashtra upto Rs. 250 crore every year to improve customer services. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OUTLOOK, Monday, April 23, 2001The Real Story Of Dabhol If a judicial probe, suggested by the committee, is ordered into the Enron deal, it could embarrass three governments    RANJIT BHUSHAN""The Committee has prima facie found infirmities in several decisions taken in respect of the Enron project at different points of time by successive governments and agencies in the Centre and state.""--Energy Review Committee headed by former home secretary Madhav GodboleThis could well be the real Enron storyA five-member high-powered committee headed by Madhav Godbole-and including former Union economic affairs secretary E.A.S. Sarma, hdfc chairman Deepak Parekh, teri chairman RajendraPachauri and Maharashtra government official Vinay Mohan Lal-has recommended a judicial probe into the entire Enron power project deal saying it signified ""the utter failure of governance that seems to have characterised almost every step of the decision-making process relating to the Dabhol project"". The report, which was submitted to the Maharashtra government last fortnight and has been acquired by Outlook, is severely critical of former chief minister Sharad Pawar (with the Congress then), the 13-day bjp-led Union government which reworked the deal in 1996, Shiv Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray and his government in Maharashtra headed by Manohar Joshi""The utter failure of governance seems to have characterised almost every step of decision-making relating to the Dabhol project."" Madhav Godbole Committee ReportAn investigation, if ordered, could embarrass at least these three governments The report clearly upholds the allegations of money being paid by Enron to politicians and bureaucrats for clinching the deal. According to the committee, the deal reveals failure of governance, both at the Centre and state, and across different agencies. ""It strains belief to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to execute responsibilities is purely coincidental,"" the report said, proposing a set of measures to be implemented if something of the project was to be retrieved. Godbole and Sarma also felt that the panel should categorically recommend the government of India to order a judicial inquiry. This was finally adopted by it. Says a Congress leader: ""Enron could well become the biggest political issue in Maharashtra and put to question liberalisation, particularly in the power sector.""The proposal has already struck panic. Says ncp's Praful Patel: ""If the Enron decision has at all been detrimental, it is because of the haste with which phase 2 was cleared by the Shiv Sena-bjp government. Now with the state having already entered into an agreement with Enron, the important thing is to resolve it amicably. A judicial inquiry will be an eyewash because it's not an issue of corruption but that of perception."" Pro-market Congressmen privately admit that it was their governments at the Centre and the state which invited Enron, even though the second phase was cleared by the bjp-Shiv Sena combine. Says Congress spokesperson Jaipal Reddy: ""Right now we're too involved with the Parliament deadlock  over Tehelka."" Pro-liberalisation Congress MPs also fear that such witch-hunting could send wrong signals to foreign investors. Non-Congress MPs from Maharashtra, meanwhile, claim that the Godbole Committee was instituted with the express purpose of politicising the Enron issue. ""I think I know Vilasrao Deshmukh's gameplan,"" says an MP from the state. But some MPs like Congress' Prithviraj Chavan question the cloak of secrecy that's surrounded the deal: ""I've maintained for long that there should be a judicial committee to examine this"".The committee report also says that had the Enron project been subjected to a techno-economic appraisal, as envisaged under provisions of the Electricity supply Act of 1948 and related legislations, the infirmities could have been avoided.Since this wasn't done, questions about a concerted effort towards exercising undue influence at every stage of the project are bound to arise, the exhaustive 93-page report points out.""I'd highlight the speed with which the 13-day Vajpayee government cleared the project minutes before it quit,"" says Congress MP Prithviraj Chavan. The Enron project had been held out as an exemplar of the impending liberalisation in the early '90s and, despite several controversies, is now an established power project at Dabhol, 150 km south of Mumbai. In July 1992, Enron signed an MoU with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (mseb) to set up a 2,550 MW station as part of the government's 'fast track' projects.Subsequently, when the Shiv-Sena-bjp came to power in Maharashtra it filed a writ against the project. This curiously led to renegotiations with Enron. The committee has quoted a Bombay High Court order on the renegotiated deal.  ""Once it (GoM) decided to revive the project, it acted in the very same manner its predecessors in office had done. It forgot all about competitive bidding and transparency. The speed with which the negotiating group studied the project and made its proposal for renegotiatons, which was accepted by Dabhol, is unprecedented."" Says Chavan: ""I would particularly like to highlight the speed with which the 13-day Vajpayee government at Centre endorsed the renegotiated project minutes before it resigned.""Since the commissioning of the plant in May 1999, the mseb has paid Rs 1,607 crore for the power it has bought from Dabhol. If the same watttage of power had been bought from Indian-built power plants fired by indigenous coal, the payment would have been approximately Rs 736 crore. In the first year-and-a-half of its operation itself, the dpc had drained the Maharashtra exchequer of nearly Rs 1,000 crore.The Central Electricity Authority (cea), in fact, pointed out that the Dabhol plant was not the least costly option. The mseb had other inexpensive alternatives like the four units of Kaparkheda, but they were in a preliminary stage. The report notes: ""...if the mseb had made efforts to seriously pursue these projects, they might not have remained in their preliminary stages"". It adds that the members were of the opinion that ""the mseb and the Maharashtra government erred seriously, based on information available at that time, in proceeding with the dpc as a base-load factor even when its capacity was reduced."" The failure seems to have been compounded by the laxity of the Union power ministry, finance ministry and the cea. It quotes the cea as saying that since the Union finance ministry found the tariff reasonable, no further examination was requiredStrangely, Bal Thackeray's Shiv Sena, when it came to power together with the BJP in Maharashtra, filed a writ in the court and then renegotiated the deal. After the new Shiv Sena-bjp government took over, its CM, Manohar Joshi, appointed a renegotiating committee in 1996 which made the right noises, actually managing to reduce the tariff. But certain things remained inexplicable. No fresh clearances were required from the cea, which also said that ""since no cost increase was involved...fresh formal clearance wasn't necessary."" Says the committee: ""This only adds strength to the suspicion that the cea didn't consider the economic aspects of the project at all. Indeed, given the non-availability of any official record of the meeting on June 24, 1994, with the Committee and the nature of this letter dated December 23, 1994, the Committee is doubtful whether the economic aspects of dpc were discussed at all.''The credibility of the Shiv Sena-bjp government has been seriously questioned. ""The Committee finds it unexplicable (sic) why there was no mention of any reduction in capital cost of the project from $2,828 million to $2,501 million as agreed by dpc in the summary report of the renegotiating committee,"" the panel observes.Says lawyer Prashant Bhushan: ""It is strange that the Shiv Sena-bjp government first filed a writ in the court and then coolly renegotiated the deal."" The committee further spells out the losses incurred through the deal. ""Subsequent to the commissioning of the dpc, the financial deterioration of mseb has been rapid. While the mseb was in profit in 1998-99, it plunged into huge losses of Rs 1681 crore in 1999-2000."" Significantly, the World Bank in 1993 had predicted the system's inherent weaknesses. In a letter written to the then power secretary, R. Vasudevan, a top bank official had said that ""after a detailed review of the analytical framework and costing assumptions, we reconfirm our earlier conclusion that the Dabhol project, as presently formulated, is not economically justified"" and that in ""our assessment the project is too large to enter the mseb system in 1998. The proposed base-load operation could result in uneconomic plant dispatch, as already existing lower variable cost coal power would be replaced by the higher cost lng power.""Enron's persistence and the 'gullibility' of the Indian side can be gauged from high-ranking Enron official Joe Sutton's letter to a key Indian official, Ajit Nimbalkar: ""I recently met with the World Bank and have been following the articles in the India papers. I feel that the World Bank opinion can be changed. We'll engage a PR firm and hopefully manage the media from here on. The project has solid support from all other agencies in Washington.""The key question in the Enron deal is whether a developed state like Maharashtra needs outside intervention in the power sector at all? For the first time the Godbole committee has raised objections about the viability of such a project. According to the report, the mseb has been one of the better performing boards in the country and has, despite a faulty transmission and distribution (T and D) system, managed to consistently earn net revenue surpluses on an accrual basis.Maharashtra accounts for nearly one-fourth of the gross value of India's industrial sector. It's one of the few states to achieve 100 per cent electrification. Since '95, the mseb has been adding to its generation. ""This improvement, which has been largely due to renovation and modernisation undertaken by the mseb, exceeded its own expectations at a time when the dpc was being considered,"" the report points out. Following a policy of cross-subsidy, roughly nine out of its ten users are subsidised.But the gap between the average cost of supply and average realisation hasn't been much. In fact, the subsidy claim decreased from Rs 630 crore in 1995-96 to Rs 355 crore in 1998-99, until in 1999-2000 it increased nearly five-fold to Rs 2,084 crore due to the sudden increase in the gap by 26 paise per unit-from 15 to 41 paise-an increase of 173 per cent. ""The increase in the subsidy claim by Rs 1,729 crore is due to the increase in the gap principally because of the increase in power purchase costs,"" says the committee, adding: ""Without the dpc and without problems of T and D loss, the mseb could be financially healthy.""But can that happen now since Enron is here to stay? The committee has come up with some far-reaching recommendations: make public all Dabhol-related documents and agreements, restructure the Dabhol project itself to bring down the cost of power, restructure dpc financially, allow sale of dpc power outside Maharashtra, re-examine ppas in accordance with least-cost plans, and thoroughly reform the mseb.The committee know this can become reality only with political consensus and through forming of public opinion. The question is, can that be achieved in an unstable political environment?With Priya Sahgal Making Of A Scam ?	1992: Centre invites Enron to set up 'fast track' power project ?

This was largely due to the disconnection drive on defaulter connections -- pegged at nearly 20,000 disconnections a month -- which resulted in compliance by consumers. With the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) monthly financial burden issue now a topic of discussion among arbitrators on the negotiating table, the MSEB has turned to putting its house in order. As if to ward of any criticism of its fiscal condition that could be termed as the facilitator to the entire DPC tariff crisis, the state electricity board has put matters relating to its performance on record. For instance, MSEB has recorded the highest power generation in the year ended March 31, 2001, at 45930 units, compared with the previous year's 45582 units, making it the top SEB of the country in this respect. Similarly its power stations recorded the highest availability percentage at 86.1 up from 84.6 per cent last fiscal. Plant load factor is up to 72.78 per cent, compared with 71.7 per cent in 2000. The Parli power station has recorded the highest ever generation in the ten years of its life time in 2000 at 4545 million units, which made it eligible for the meritorious productivity award under the eligibility guidelines issued by the Government of India carrying a cash award of Rs 12.5 lakh. All other power stations in the state, without exception, also fulfill the eligibility criteria for the cash award, a senior MSEB official said. Similarly, the Chandrapur power station became the first power station of any state electricity board to get the ISO 9002 certification. A senior MSEB official said: ""Earlier MSEB was suffering from too much interference in its day to day functioning. The agriculturists were touted as the major reason for its deteriorating accruals, while theft of electricity during the transmission and distribution stage was conveniently camouflaged under this head. In the recent past, the government has authorised MSEB to take steps to curb this misuse of power by its own officials, many of whom, including a chief engineer have suffered suspensions",0

We did talk to some extent about the guarantees, but we didn't get too far and they're willing to accept at this point that what's acceptable to the LNG suppliers, should be suitable for their needs.

State govt. to renegotiate Dabhol Power Project , By Hubert Vaz THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Friday Apr 27 2001DPC board empowers MD to cancel MSEB contractTHE ENRON power project crisis on Thursday deepened with the board of Dabhol Power Company authorising the management to issue a termination notice to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board even while international lenders to the project asked Enron to renegotiate power purchase agreement signed with the MSEB.The decision to authorise managing director Neil McGregor to issue ""notice of termination on the contract to sell 740 MW of power"" was taken after the board prevented MSEB from voting on the ground that it was an interested party. The decision was taken with six votes in favour and the single opposition vote was cast by IDBI, sources said. According to reports, financial institutions such as ANZ Investment Bank, Credit Suisse First Boston, Citibank, ABN-Amro and the State Bank of India have on Wednesday advised Enron against terminating its PPA with MSEB. MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal, who with two other directors attended the meeting on Wednesday representing Maharashtra's 15 per cent stake in the near $3-billion project, said: ""The Indian side told them that it would be unfortunate if Enron broke the contract."" While Bansal declined comment on the board decision, the sources said the Indian side had expressed its interest to holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the state. (PTI)THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Friday Apr 27 2001MSEB pays Rs 134cr under 'protest' to DPC DESPITE the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head, Maharashtra State Electricity Board on Thursday made a ""protest payment"" of Rs 134 crore disputed amount, towards March bill of Rs 146.64 crore to Dabhol. ""We were ready with the payment on Wednesday itself, but DPC officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh"", a senior MSEB official said. ""We have disputed payment of Rs 12.64 crore and it would be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum, of which Enron India managing director K Wade Cline and Krishna Rao are members"", MSEB sources said. Last week, DPC had dashed off a communication to the government and MSEB that it would not accept ""protest payments"" anymore. Cline had said the energy major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums, which MSEB in fact owed DPC in full and that the company would also not recognise the ""purported protest or reservation"". MSEB had paid a Rs 113.5 crore February bill in protest last month. On April 23 last, both domestic and international lenders of DPC had met in London and held exhaustive discussions the multinational's move to issue a termination notice to MSEB and state government. (PTI) BUSINESS STANDARD, Friday, April 27, 001Enron India MD authorised to terminate PPAThe board of the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC), at its meeting in London on Wednesday, authorised the managing director of Enron India to issue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and the state government. ""The board has authorised Wade Cline to serve the termination notice. However, this does not mean that the termination notice will be served immediately. It is only an enabling provision and will be used only if the situation arises,"" a state government source told Business Standard from London. He said DPC was under pressure from its lenders. The DPC spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue. The hardening of the board's stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of DPC's lenders, who had warned Enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice. The lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage. Serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders, who have an exposure of about $2 billion in the project. Sources said given the lenders' strong opposition to termination of the contract, the Enron board's ""enabling resolution"" did not have much significance beyond conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio. The Maharashtra Chief Minister had warned Enron not to scuttle the process of crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice. The state government is to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the Dabhol contract. Enron holds 65 per cent in DPC, while US-based GE and Bechtel hold 10 per cent each. The balance 15 per cent is held by MSEB through a special purpose vehicle, Maharashtra Power Development Corporation. The MSEB representatives were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party. The IDBI representative protested against the board's decision. The meeting was attended by state energy secretary VM Lal. The meeting was held against the backdrop of a dispute between MSEB and DPC over payment of bills. After MSEB failed to pay Rs 102 crore towards the December 2000 bill, DPC invoked the state government's guarantee and then the Union government's counter guarantee. When payment of the Rs 127-crore January bill became overdue, DPC again invoked the state government's guarantee. MSEB retaliated on January 28, 2001 by slapping a Rs 401-crore penalty for non-supply of electricity at adequate levels. It demanded that DPC adjust the bills against this penalty. ""This stand of MSEB was explained to DPC at the board meeting"", a state government official said. The Centre also supported MSEB's stand and refused to honour the counter guarantee. The power company then invoked the political force majeure clause. A process of conciliation and arbitration between the Centre and DPC is currently on. THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Friday, April 27, 2001Foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to DPC , Sanjay Jog & Raghu MohanGlobal banks comfortable with Enron pull-outLenders to the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) are a sharply divided lot. International lenders, in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones led by the the Industrial Develoment Bank of India (IDBI), are categorical that additional assistance to DPC's phase-II will be held in abeyance despite the completion of 92 per cent of the project work.The stage is also set for a preliminary termination notice to be served by DPC to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) within the next four weeks.This follows the authorisation given to Enron India's managing director K Wade Cline and DPC president & CEO Neil McGregor to serve the termination notice, and transfer notices to MSEB, following Wednesday's DPC board meeting in London.The essence of the message from the international lenders following the London meeting with DPC board is: Emotions do not work. Contractual obligations and payments have to be met. We are convinced that the MSEB has failed to meet its obligations. There is no point in Enron continuing with the project and the company should get out of it.The structuring of DPC's debt has created two classes of lenders. In phase-I, international lenders are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase-II, no lender is. However, all lenders have a parri passu charge, making attachment of assets a messy affair.Sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to phase-II of the project are worried that an awry DPC project will affect their interests more given that they have no security - other than assets - like a sovereign cover. ""It was this desperation that made local lenders like IDBI slash the interest rates a few months back to 16.5 per cent from 21.5 per cent,"" a leading foreign banker pointed out.Three points that were made clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were: a) there are contractual obligations b) MSEB was not punctual in its payments to DPC and c) MSEB adopted a confrontational position by slapping a Rs 401 crore rebate charge on DPC for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power.While local lenders led by IDBI - with MSEB parroting the same - were of the view that the current situation is a temporary one, international lenders were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out. This is despite the stance taken by IDBI and MSEB that authorisation for termination given to Mr Cline and Mr McGregor was not called for. International bankers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped in its present form.The points of contention are: a) that phase-I of DPC is backed by a sovereign guarantee b) phase-II is not and c) to the extent that phase-II is covered by assets, cancellation of phase-II may see all assets - even those under phase-I - getting attached. Therefore, an examination on the segregation of assets under phase-I and phase-II is now warranted.PTI adds: In a significant move, DPC board has empowered its management to sever power supply agreement with MSEB, a move that could inflict a financial liability of about Rs 2840 crore on the Centre. A decision to authorise DPC president Neil McGregor to issue a termination notice to MSEB for sale of power was taken by the board at its meeting on Wednesday. THE INDIAN EXPRESS, Friday, April 27, 2001Enron: Dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the MSEBTHE BOARD of Dabhol Power Company, a subsidiary of Houston-based Enron Corp, has decided to warn the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) that it intends to pull the plug on its Guhagar-based project.In a board meeting held in London on Wednesday, the board decided to authorise DPC President and CEO Neil McGregor and Enron India's managing director K Wade Cline to serve a ''preliminary'' termination notice for sale of power to the MSEB within the next four weeks.The Dabhol project has been mired in disputes since MSEB began missing payments last year. MSEB owes Dabhol Power $48 million for power delivered in December and January. The payment ran into a dispute after MSEB slapped penalty notices of Rs 401 crore on DPC for its failure to supply power within three hours of the demand being placed.But MSEB has paid $24 million for February. And a payment of $31 million was made for March on Thursday.The $3 billion Dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in India to date. Issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable Dabhol to suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes.While a preliminary termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to the abandonment of the project by Enron, analysts have described the decision as a ''procedural'' move consistent with DPC's negotiating strategy to recover overdue payments from the MSEB.After the company issues the preliminary termination notice, step two would be an official termination notice, and step three would be a notice that the company is surrendering control of the project. If the project is terminated, the government of India will have to take a hit of $300 million besides paying bills of Rs 1,500 crore for the next one year to Enron as penalty. ''Our (Centre's) liability, if Dabhol power project is terminated, would be one year's electricity bill and a termination fee of $300 million,'' Power Secretary A K Basu said.''Contractually, the Centre will have to pay one year's electricity bill, totalling at present prices about Rs 1,400-1,500 crore, and take over DPC's debt, which stands at around $300 million, if the project was terminated,'' Basu said in Delhi. Dabhol Power is in the process of completing the second phase of the 2,184-megawatt power-plant project, which is 95 per cent through.While the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company to get out of the project, Indian lenders, led by IDBI, are asking the company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice. During the meeting in London, MSEB which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project, had strongly opposed DPC's move to authorise Cline and McGregor to issue notices for termination.MSEB Chairman Vinay Bansal and technical director Prem Paunikar - both directors on the DPC board - and the state principal secretary (energy) VM Lal, an invitee to the board, raised the issue at the board meeting in London. MSEB claimed that DPC was needlessly ''threatening'' to issue various arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of PPA in isolation.In recent weeks, Dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the MSEB, delivering a notice of political force majeure to Maharashtra - a step typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war, coup, or a similar radical political event. In this case, DPC's move was viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity.DPC has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power. Critics object to the company charging Rs 7.1 a kilowatt-hour for its power, compared with around Rs 1.5 a kilowatt-hour charged by other suppliers.THE HINDU, Friday, April 27, 2001Offer of renegotiation 'too late': Enron, By Mahesh Vijapurkar MUMBAI, APRIL 26. The Enron-sponsored Dabhol Power Company, which last night authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, has decided to keep a stiff upper lip. This, in turn, has stoked speculation that the switching off of power from its Phase I plant was imminent, while in reality, a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the PPA. As one source familiar with the PPA told The Hindu, ``it is not sudden death of the project'' and in all probability, the DPC, vexed with the developments, including sharp and pointed observations by the Godbole Committee, has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option. ``This would only eventually come into effect. It is not an overnight operation and a lot of legal work is involved''. Apparently, the DPC intends to do some arm-twisting. At the board of directors meeting in London, which Maharashtra was initially disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions on the project, the DPC squarely told the MSEB nominees on the board that the offer of renegotiation had come rather ``too late''. It also said it did not see any room for optimism about the outcome. It did not, however, rule out the option of talks, thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to authorise termination was a new weapon. The Maharashtra Chief Minister, Mr. Vilasrao Deshmukh, had hoped that DPC would not take any ``harsh step'' which would cause lot of damage to the interests of both the independent power producer and the Government and today he expressed his dismay. In fact, the mandate of the team that went, on the strength of its stake in the DPC, was to put across the idea that negotiation was the requirement and not confrontation. Echo in LS The Enron issue also echoed in the Lok Sabha today where the Power Minister, Mr. Suresh Prabhu, said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the Centre Rs. 2,840 crores, whose liability in the project agreement was limited. The Centre's liability in case of termination is one year's electricity bill and a termination fee of $300 million. Blow to FIs The termination could prove to be a serious blow to the Indian Financial Institutions (FIs) which, under the leadership of the IDBI, were trying to convince the other lenders of the project against the notice. The exposure of Indian FIs in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee either of the Centre or the State. THE TIMES OF INDIA, Friday ,27 April 2001Enron ready to pull out, but lenders say wait The Dabhol Power Company board, which met on Wednesday in London, authorised the company management to issue a termination notice to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. The company, however, may not pull out of the project yet, considering its lenders, who met on Monday, opposed such a move and favoured renegotiations. Sources present during both the meetings said that though foreign lenders supported Enron on the termination issue, domestic financial institutions, led by the Industrial Development Bank of India, prevailed over the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move. Enron needs the lenders' consent to file a pre-termination notice for pulling out from the project. The decision to empower DPC chief Wade Cline to issue a termination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single IDBI vote against such a move. Another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of Phase II of the project will depend on the Government of India assuring payment mechanisms. Institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package, which is crucial for completing the Phase II expansion project. ``The board has given powers to Wade Cline to issue a pre-termination notice. But the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the project but to initiate serious re-negotiation proceedings,'' said MSEB Chairman Vinay Bansal, who attended the board meeting. ``MSEB presented their views to the board members and it was understood by Enron which also included the Rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings. ``We have also made it clear that the tariff structure of Enron is quite high and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable,"" Bansal added. ``They cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction,'' said a top banker who was present during the lenders' meet. ``There is a general consensus that the project must be completed and the proposal to terminate the PPA should be kept in abeyance,'' he added. The global arrangers for the DPC include ANZ Investment Bank, Credit Suisse First Boston, ABN-AMRO, Citibank and the State Bank of India, where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials. However, some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project favours such proceedings. Meanwhile, in a clear reversal of roles, Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the PPA. ``We will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that would be bad news for all of us, including DPC,'' Deshmukh said. Deshmukh was echoing Union Power Minister Suresh Prabhu's sentiments, who said that the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row. He, however, added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments, and dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the $2.9 billion project would be a blow to India's efforts to woo foreign investors. The DPC has already slapped one conciliation notice on the Centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non-payment of dues amounting to Rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for December 2000 and January 2001. Meanwhile, MSEB officials said in Mumbai that the March bills amounting to Rs 134 crore was paid on Thursday as protest payment, despite the dispute over the amount. When asked on the future course of action, Bansal said it was up to the DPC.THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE, Friday, April 27, 2001DPC board authorises MD to issue PPA termination notice THE board of directors of Dabhol Power Company (DPC) has authorised the Managing Director, Mr Neil McGregor, to issue the notice of intent to terminate its power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) ``at an appropriate time''. The decision was taken at a board meeting held in London yesterday. ``While MSEB, which is an `interested party', was not allowed to vote, it made a presentation clarifying its stand on the matter,'' a senior State Government official said. The resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice was carried by six votes to one. IDBI voted against the decision, the official said. The serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a six-month ``suspension period''. According to clause 17.8 of the Termination Procedure, of the PPA: ``Following the giving of a preliminary termination notice, the parties shall consult for a period of six months (or such longer period as they may agree) as to what step shall be taken with a view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all the circumstances...'' IDBI and State Bank of India, the principal Indian lenders, had earlier persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination notice for some more time. At least one lender has to consent for the company to serve termination notice. It is understood that overseas lenders are in favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent. However, domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the PPA is abandoned mid-way. According to institutional sources, Indian lenders are trying to get all the parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues. The Maharashtra and Central Governments too are in favour of a conciliation. Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh, Chief Minister of Maharashtra, yesterday went on record that the State did not want the project terminated. Mr Yashwant Sinha, Union Finance Minister, is also understood to be of the same opinion. ``The DPC will now have to decide what is the `appropriate time' to serve the notice,'' the official said. MSEB pays Rs 134 crore: Meanwhile, MSEB has paid DPC Rs 134 crore towards its March 2001 bill. MSEB officials confirmed that the bill was paid `in protest'' today morning. ``They (DPC) had billed us for an amount of Rs 146 crore. We do not agree with some of the items included,'' a senior MSEB official said. THE PIONEER, Friday, April 27, 2001Enron testing Maharashtra's nerves, T N RaghunathaDabhol Power Company (DPC) has begun to put fresh pressure on the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the Maharashtra State Government and the Centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them, if the DPC Board of Directors' decision to authorise its managing director to serve a contract termination notice to the MSEB is any indication.The DPC Board, in its meeting in London on Wednesday, empowered the company management to sever its power supply agreement with MSEB, a move that could inflict a financial liability of Rs 2,840 crore on the Centre. The decision to authorise the DPC management to issue a termination notice to MSEB was taken by a vote of six to one after the Maharasthra Government representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of ""interested party"".When contacted, the company's Mumbai-based spokesperson, Mr Jimmy Mogal, declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the DPC Board. ""We have nothing to say on the reports emanating from London. We will express our views after a few days,"" he said. However, Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh on Thursday termed the DPC board's decision as ""unfortunate"". ""We have already requested the company not to take any harsh decision"", Mr Deshmukh said in Mumbai. Official sources in the State Energy Ministry interpreted the DPC Board's decision as a pressure tactic employed by the Enron subsidiary to force the MSEB to clear the pending power bills without any further delay. Through its tough posture, the DPC wants to make its position stronger before it can formally agree for re-negotiations with the MSEB, the Centre and the State Government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the State electricity board. The sources said that the DPC's reported decision to authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the MSEB did not mean that the Enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping of the power contract with the MSEB.""If anything, the DPC's reported decision is to mount additional pressure on the MSEB for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger position in settling its dispute with the MSEB. As part of its plan to arm itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its control, the DPC had recently served a political force majeure to the MSEB, the Centre and the State Government,"" the sources said.Not surprisingly, the DPC's London decision comes on the heels of the Maharashtra Government's decision to set up a high-level committee, comprising representatives of the MSEB, the Centre and the State Government to re-negotiate with the Enron's subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the State electricity board.Meanwhile, amidst the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head, the MSEB on Thursday made a ""protest payment"" of the Rs 134 crore disputed amount towards March bill of Rs 146.64 crore to DPC.riday, April 27THE TELEGRAPH, Friday, April 27, 2001ENRON SIGNAL TO SWITCH OFF DABHOL POWER  Enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy-ridden Dabhol Power Company when it won an authorisation from the company's board to stop sale of power to Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). The meeting of the company, of which the Houston-based energy giant holds 65 per cent and the MSEB 15 per cent, was attended by state energy secretary V M Lal and MSEB technical director P Paunikar and it came days after its lenders discussed payment problems and a possible termination.The Centre's liability, if Enron decides to snap the agreement, will be a year's power bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million. However, the company will have to wait for six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug.The Centre shrugged off the move, saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power if Enron walks out. ""We do not see FDI inflows into the power sector being hit,"" power minister Suresh Prabhu said.MSEB officials said the ball is now in the court of DPC, which said its corporate policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings. The decision coincided with a Rs 134-crore 'protest payment' by the cash-strapped power board as part of the March bill worth Rs 146.64 crore.There was speculation that MSEB coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers at Enron's hub in Houston, and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head. MSEB officials brushed away the allusions, saying the cheque was ready on Wednesday but could not be handed over to DPC because of the state-wide bandh. ""We have a disputed payment of Rs 12.64 crore, which will be taken up at the dispute-resolution forum,"" a board official said. Last week, DPC told the state government and MSEB it would no longer accept protest payments in a move to fortify its legal position. MSEB officials say Bechtel and General Electric, the other partners who hold around 20 per cent in DPC, are willing to go along with Enron Corp in terminating the deal but financial institutions such as IDBI are not game because it puts their loans at risk. Investments made by Indian institutions are not covered under the Centre's and state's counter-guarantees, unlike those made by international lenders.Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh called Enron's decision unfortunate. ""We had told state government officials attending the Enron board meeting to stop the company from winding up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties.""THE STATESMAN, Friday, April 27, 2001Enron threatens to pull out  The Enron crisis deepened with the Board of Directors of the Dabhol Power Company deciding to authorise the managing director, Mr K Wade Cline, to serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the $2.9 billion power project.The decision, which could lead to the cessation of Dabhol's power supply to the state, was taken at the meeting held yesterday in London according to reports quoting the chairman of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, Mr Vinay Bansal. While DPC officials refuse to comment on anything, it is learnt that MSEB was itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before the meeting.MSEB was said to have been dissuaded by the Nationalist Congress Party president, Mr Sharad Pawar, and union power minister Mr Suresh Prabhu, who had talks in New Delhi with the Maharashtra chief minister, Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh, and an MSEB delegation last Monday.The state government has been served two arbitration notices while the Centre is ready to go for conciliation with the DPC for failing to honour its counter-guarantee.Further, the DPC has already slapped a notice of political force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of exigencies that force it to take an extreme step.The union power minister, Mr Suresh Prabhu, contended in Delhi that since DPC contributed only 0.7 per cent of the total energy output of the country, its termination would not have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation. However, if terminations proceedings go through, Enron Corp, a 65 per cent share-holder in the Dabhol Power Company, would stand to net a hefty amount in damages. The union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termination of the DPC would cost the Centre Rs 1,800 crore, which is the total of one years' electricity bill and a termination fee of $300 million. According to an energy analyst, Mr Pradyumna Kaul, the total liability would not cross Rs 350 crore. However Mr Prabhu said in the Lok Sabha today that the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the Centre Rs 2,840 crore.It is learnt that on 20 April, Mr Deshmukh had given the go-ahead to the MSEB to prepare a legal notice to be issued to Enron during the meeting of the DPC's Board of Directors on Wednesday. At the meeting, the energy minister, Padamsinh Patil, energy secretary, Mr Vinay Mohan Lal and MSEB chairman Mr Vinay Bansal, were also present.The notice was prepared over the past weekend and taken by the delegation when they called on Mr Prabhu on 24 April. However, the politicians convinced them that Enron would not get tough, given its huge stake in the project, and that such a notice would not be necessary. The meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff, with Enron's consent.Among those present at the London meeting were Mr Lal, Mr Bansal and MSEB technical director, Mr P Paunikar, in their capacity as directors. However, they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party. The only vote to go against the decision was that of the IDBI which is also represented on the board, it is learnt.The chief minister, Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh, said the state was not in favour of terminating the project. This could mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm-twist the Indian authorities could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the past three months cleared.The MSEB owes Enron Rs 146.64 crore for March 2001 and Rs 229 crore for December 2000 and January 2001.The Centre today put up a brave face on Enron's decision saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country, PTI reported from New Delhi.""There will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or foreign company. As far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact on FDI in power sector,"" Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told reporters when asked about DPC's decision to authorise management to issue a termination notice to MSEB.Emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision, Prabhu said after the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs ""we are expecting cooperation from many Scandinavian countries as well as European nations in the power sector.""In fact not only the Power Minister but also the Prime Minister of Norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector.""MID DAY'DPC may not wind up'Maharashtra Chief Secretary V Ranganathan has said that though Neil McGregor, managing director of the Dabhol Power Corporation (DPC), has been given complete powers with regard to DPC's operations in the state, including the authority to wind up operations, it does not necessarily mean that McGregor will issue such a termination notice. McGregor was given the powers at a meeting of the DPC board in London on Wednesday. Ranganathan said that state officials, including Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) Chairman Vinay Bansal and Power Secretary V M Lal, have reported back to him about the meeting in London.With regard to the state's failure to pay Enron, Ranganathan said, "" Bills are prepared as per the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and DPC owes some money to us. Our people informed Enron officials about this.. In fact, there was no reason to give powers to the MD to slap a termination notice.""In the London meeting, MSEB and Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) representatives insisted that the DPC must pay Rs 411 crore since it could not supply power whenever needed. Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the decision of the board of the Enron-promoted DPC to give McGregor powers to wind up operations. Deshmukh added, "" We have already requested Enron not to take any harsh decision.""Deshmukh had earlier said, "" We have directed state Government officials attending the DPC board meeting to desist the energy company from winding up operations in the state, as it would be harmful to both of us.""Enron officials are keeping mum on the issue. McGregor said, "" I am not going to give any comment.""MID DAY, April 27, 2001Enron offers 'no comment' on renegotiation, H S RaoA crucial meeting of the Board of Directors of the Dabhol Power Company (DPC), promoted by the US energy major Enron, was held here yesterday apparently to discuss fate of its $900-million power project in Maharashtra, but there was no official word on the Indian and state Governments' decision to renegotiate the contract. An Enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting, saying the issues discussed at the meeting were 'confidential' . "" We have not received any direct communication. Unless we get it and evaluate the details, we have no comments to make,"" the spokesman said when asked about the proposed decision on re-negotiation of the project in which the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has 15 per cent stake.Asked whether the Board had taken a decision on empowering DPC Managing Director Neil McGregor to wind up its operations in India, the spokesman said he had nothing to say on them. Enron has reportedly authorised Mcgregor to look at various options including selling the company's stake in DPC. Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said in Mumbai that the state Government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company. He said the Maharashtra government "" is not in favour of terminating the 2184-MW project, but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio.""MID DAY, Friday, April 27, 2001,Committee to renegotiate Enron dealA committee to renegotiate the Power Purchase Agreement with the Dabhol Power Company will be appointed by this evening, Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said today. Addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted social reformer Anna Hazare at his official residence Varsha, Deshmukh said the committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow, at the most.He termed as unfortunate the Enron board decision empowering DPC chief Neil McGregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue with power company."" Renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the Godbole committee and the center will also depute its representative on the renegotiating committee. We don't want to take any hasty decision,"" Deshmukh saidHe pointed that the only bone of contention with the DPC had been its expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably.When pointed that the Enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite state s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee, Chief Minister said it was unfortunate.Earlier, in his meeting with Hazare, Deshmukh promised to make necessary amendments to the Right to Information law recently passed by the state so that the information was easily accessed by the common people. He also gave a patient hearing to Hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry within three months. AFTERNOON, APRIL 27, 2001 'ENRON'S ON!' State govt. to renegotiate Dabhol Power Project , By Hubert Vaz The US power giant, Enron Power Corporation's willingness to wrap up the Dabhol Power Project and leave the shores may not actually materialise, though the Dabhol Power Company chief, Mr. Wade Cline, has been authorised to do so, since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the matter. Disclosing this, Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh confirmed this morning that the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power project at Dabhol could be continued, and at the same time Enron did not feel slighted. ""Enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision. We are waiting for their letter,"" he said. When asked what sort of compromise the state government plans to forge, Mr. Deshmukh said, ""Let our officers come back. After that we will decide a future course of action. But we are definitely going in for renegotiation of the project. It is very difficult to predict the outcome of Enron's decision but as of now the project is still on."" When asked whether the project could be moved to another state, if wound up from Maharashtra, Mr. Deshmukh said, that was not possible as per the terms of the agreement between the US company and the state government. However, it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself, he indicated. He also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses if the project was terminated. The board of directors of the Dabhol Power Company, which met in London on Wednesday, decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project once and for all by empowering the DPC chief to terminate the project, if he deemed it fit. However, this decision, as of now, does not necessarily indicate the death knell for the project. The Enron project, which had been riddled with controversies right from its inception, had been a pretext for the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to time. The previous Sena-BJP government, which had been out to terminate the project, however, chose to continue with it following renegotiations with Enron's top visiting officials like Ms. Rebecca Mark. And, the Democratic Front government inherited the controversial project when the governments changed hands a year and a half ago. Meanwhile, State Energy Minister Dr. Padamsinh Patil, when contacted at the Osmanabad Circuit House, said the state government and the central government have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with Enron. ""It is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that. They will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both sides,"" he said. In case the project is terminated, the government can still manage the power needs of the state, though it would be a bit tough job, he added. ",0

"NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: PHIL HOCHMUTHon LINUXToday's focus: Will Linux be a hit or miss on the corporate desktop?03/15/00Dear Wincenty Kaminski,Today's focus: Will Linux be a hit or miss on the corporate desktop?---------------------------------------------By Phil HochmuthSo far this year, the buzz about Linux in enterprise networks hasfocused on servers and embedded systems, with the growth of Linuxsevers being most heralded. According to IDC, a research firm based inFramingham, Mass., Linux was the fastest-growing server operatingsystem last year, with a 93% growth rate over the year before. Linuxwas the second most-shipped operating system in 1999 after Windows NT,capturing 24% of new licenses shipped.As for the embedded market, Linux has emerged as an ideal platform fornetwork appliances, because the system can be modified to handlespecialized, dedicated tasks very well. Companies such as CobaltNetworks, Picazo and Progressive Systems have announced Linux-basedappliances, ranging from Web servers to PBXs to firewalls.But what of the open source hacker,s dream of &Linux on every desktop?8Sure, Linux on the desktop has become more accessible than ever, withcolorful, shrink-wrapped boxes of Caldera, Red Hat and Corel Linux nowavailable at places like CompUSA. However, analysts have said thatLinux,s growth in the enterprise will be limited to the macro and microareas of network servers and embedded operating systems.According to IDC, Linux currently runs on only 4% of U.S. desktops. Thehold Microsoft Windows has on the desktop market will remain strong,analysts say, despite such factors as Microsoft,s antitrust problemsand the surging popularity of Linux.Even some Linux executives are skeptical of their product,s desktopfuture. Recently, SuSE CEO Roland Dyroff downplayed Linux,s future ondesktops. Dyroff said, &given the lack of applications available, wereally can't claim it as being competitive on the desktop yet.8A recent survey by Survey.com gives more hope for Linux desktops.According to the survey of 1,640 enterprise network managers, opensource operating systems are used on 10% of desktops, with the numberjumping to a surprising 23% of enterprise desktops by 2002.Despite the mix of numbers being thrown around, two important factorsthat will determine the success of Linux as an enterprise clientdesktop are: a standardized, easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI)and available applications.One company that is working to make Linux more user friendly is PaloAlto-based Eazel, which is designing a next-generation file managementsystem and user interface to run on top of the Linux kernel. Accordingto Eazel,s Web site, the company,s goal is to bring Linux to the massesand &do it in a way that appeals to today's Linux users and to meremortals.8The company was founded by a group of former Apple executives, and isallied with the Gnome project, which has been doing extensive Linuxdesktop environment development for several years. Eazel is due to havea product out by the middle of this year. With an intuitive, icon-basedfile management environment, Eazel is hoping its user interface will bean improvement over the two current Linux GUIs, Gnome and KDE, and willhelp standardized the look and feel of Linux for &regular8 users. Forenterprise mangers who have already embraced Linux on the server side,this development will be worth keeping an eye on.On the applications side, several office productivity suites have beenavailable for some time, such as Sun,s StarOffice suite and KOffice forthe KDE desktop. Corel has also ported its office products, such asWordPerfect, over to Linux to complement its own distribution of theoperating system. While there have been recent rumors (started by LinuxCare Vice President Arthur Tyde) that Microsoft is working on a port ofMS Office to Linux, Microsoft officials deny this.While Linux may never supplant Windows as the industry-standard desktop,there should be plenty of opportunity for Linux PCs in enterprise netsin the future.To contact Phil Hochmuth:-------------------------Phil Hochmuth is a writer and researcher for Network World, and a formersystems integrator.

"Hi Dorn & John, as you discovered recently, I am still 'officially' in Vince Kaminski's group (my original Enron Corp. group). This holds true for Shalesh Ganjoo as well.  I did not explicitly pick Dorn or John as reviewers thinking that they will show up automatically as a result of my assumed reporting structure.  So, Vince has agreed to 'host' the review in his group and proceed to transfer me over to EBS officially when this quarter is overs (Apprently that was scheduled to be automatic).  In the mean time, Vasant, Stinson or Vince would like to get a e-mail from either Dorn or John regarding my performance from their perspective for consideration as soon as possible.I had plan on being on vacation starting tomorrow and have made arrangement with my family already.  Since I am not reviewing Shalesh directly (since he is in Research under Stionson), I am assuming I don't have to attend the review meetin tommorrow. I'll be on the road starting in the morning.  If I change this, I am told at home, that I will be in the market for another family!  I can phone in if that is okay. Kayla, could you page me with the details?Regards,Ravi.",0

But that's exactly what a subsidiary of Houston-based energy and communications conglomerate Enron Corp. is doing by launching a business-to-business exchange that it said will seek to match spare capacity owned by storage service providers (SSP) with corporate users who want to be able to quickly scale up and down the amounts of storage they have available. Enron Broadband Services this week announced that it has already signed a deal with Waltham, Mass.-based StorageNetworks Inc. and is negotiating similar agreements with at least six other SSPs. If successful, analysts said, Enron's business proposition could go far toward generating a set of operating standards for the emerging SSP business. ""It's a market with mix of small and large players and companies that define their roles differently,"" said Ken Weilerstein, an analyst at Gartner Group Inc. in Stamford, Conn. Enron's plan also could help enterprise-level users get additional benefits along with the storage capacity they're renting, such as security and disaster recovery support, he added. Ravi Thuraisingham, director of global bandwidth risk management at Enron Broadband Services, said the new offering won't include additional security features. But Enron does plan to standardize on a set of SSP services and bundle them with disaster recovery and communications bandwidth capabilities, he said. Initially, Enron -- which had total revenue of $101 billion last year -- expects to charge users monthly fees of $25 to $55 per gigabyte of managed storage, depending on market conditions and the length of time a company expects to need the capacity. ""We're there to try to discover a market clearing price,"" said Thuraisingham, adding that the service is tentatively due to go online in the third quarter. Enron said it has already signed Best Buy Co., one of the leading retailers of consumer electronics, computers and software in the U.S., to buy the storage capacity it needs to support a customer relationship management application through StorageNetworks. Connecting users such as Best Buy to available storage could take anywhere from three days to three months, according to Thuraisingham. Under Enron's plan, storage capacity owned by participating SSPs will be connected to an existing network of switching hubs through which the company currently trades telecommunications bandwidth. Enron said it has 18 switching centers, or ""pooling points,"" in the U.S., and another seven overseas. At first, the company plans to focus its attention on SSPs in Boston and other metropitan areas where the necessary networking plumbing can be easily installed. But even there, Thuraisingham said, Enron is ""pretty much in the initial stages of getting SSPs up to speed on what the market is about."" Enron has been managing online trades of telecommunications bandwidth since the spring of 1999. Later that year, it also launched a Web site called EnronOnline that oversees the trading of natural gas, electricity and other commodities. That quickly became the world's largest e-commerce site and is now said to be processing more than $1 billion worth of transactions daily.

My phone number is (617) 492-9551.  I graduated from Princeton University in 1996 (mathematics), and came straight to MIT for aPh.D. in Operations Management at the Sloan Schoolof Management.  In my firstthree years I took all the required coursework in mathematics,optimization, stochastic processes, etc., as well as a number of courses inpsychology (at MIT and Harvard).  I am working with Prof. Gabriel Bitran,and I am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations.  Inparticular, I am interested in the interaction between customers andcompanies (hence the interest in psychology).  The (tentative) title of myPhD thesis is ""Pricing Substitute Products on the Internet"", and I amsending you the summary which I sent to Tom Gros a few weeks ago that willgive you an idea of what this research is about.Thanks again, and I'm looking forward to meeting you and your researchgroup next week.PauloPricing Substitute Products on the InternetObjective:To develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services soldonthe internet.Motivation:This research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and optimizationmodels are not appropriate for internet-related businesses.  The technologicalinnovations associated with the internet brought about an overload ofinformationwhich inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices.Furthermore,companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers canhave access to.The problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issuefacedby internet companies.  Consumers usually search for generic products (e.g.VCRsor computers) without knowing exactly what they will buy.  Companies can showdifferent products and different prices to each consumer.  This type offlexibilitywas not available until the internet came about.The problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet.  Themethodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number ofother settings, such as pricing services.  Services are unique, and there aremany cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by agiven company.  Our model will help companies decide which services to offerto which customers and how much to charge for these services.Research Strategy:Our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two componentswhich can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies.  Thesecomponents are choice models and optimization models.Choice Models:Choice models describe how customers make choices.  The management literaturedraws on two main sources for these models: psychology and economics.  Thecommon approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristicelimination methods.  These methods consist of the elimination of optionsbased on the sequential elimination of features until only one choiceremains.These methods tend to be very context-specific and do not lend themselves veryeasily to mathematical analysis.  Economists focus on utility-maximing modelsthat are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychologicalmodels.The most common economic model of choice is the logit model.  The problem withthese types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of howconsumer make choices on the internet.  The first step in our research willbeto develop choice models that capture the interactions going on betweencustomersand companies on the internet.Optimization:Traditionally, the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over acertain planning horizon.  On the internet, the problem of maximizing revenuestill exists, but there is also a need to learn about customers.  Short termprofit is based on sales, but long term profit is based on how well you knowyour customers and are able to retain them.  The optimization problem musttherefore include a short term component (sales) and a long term component(learning).",0

Well I hope.I hope you don,t mind me writing to you. You may remember that 5 months agoI left Risk Publications and moved to a charity. Having been here for only afew months, I have decided that this job is not for me (I miss the buzz of acorporate office) and I have decided to move back into the corporate sector.Because of my previous experience and knowledge of the energy sector, I amvery interested in moving into this area. I have always thought that itwould be great to work for Enron because it is such a dynamic company and Iam planning to approach the London office to discuss any opportunities,which might be available. I am particularly interested in product marketingand research, although I am very open-minded at the moment. I wonderedwhether you could recommend the right person to speak to in London.I know that you are incredibly busy, but any help you can give me would befantastic Vince.Thanks and best regards,Vicky Windsor_________________________________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.Share information about yourself, create your own public profile athttp://profiles.msn.com.",0

"Chonawee and I just had a phone conversation with Cplex. There are other alternatives (products) that may help in saving time and cost. Chonawee and I feel that one floating develoment license, and one or two OPL (a package on sale that provides modeling and optimization features) licenses will do. In addition, we need floating deployment licenses. For the development licenses, the charges should be split ""equally"" between the different groups that may ask for optimization help (although it is hard to predict who may ask for future help). We are suggesting equally since these licenses are used to develop the needed solution but are not (in general) used to run the software. The deployment licenses can be charged on per-use basis for different groups.Cplex is going to send us a new quote. We'll make the decision soon after that.-Samer",0

As a result of researchassistance he has done for me, he knows the California market very welland is familiar with the other ISOs.  I think he would be an excellentmatch for you.

Prof. Buehler is the head of the faculty of finance at Mannheim University in Germany. Currently, he is writing a study about the hedging strategy that led to the Metallgesellschaft debacle. For this study he would like to get forward oil prices form us.The forward oil prices should be for WTI with Cushing as the delivery point for the time period July 1986 and December 1996 with remaining contract durations between one and ten years. It would be ideal to get this data on a daily basis. Weekly or monthly data is helpful as well, of course. Since Mannheim University is among Enron's tier one recruiting universities in Germany, it would be great if we could help him with some data.

Dabei waere eine hoheDatenfrequenz ideal (taeglich, ansonsten woechentlich odermonatlich). Zusaetzlich waeren auch Spotpreise fuer WTI mitLieferung in Cushing nuetzlich.Diese idealen Datenanforderungen werden sich vermutlich nichterfuellen lassen.

"                  Dear  Vince:         Thank you for  the invitation yesterday. It was a pleasure to meet you all and learn more about  the group, it's structure and to some extent what you are involved in. Please  extend my thanks to all of them.         I am  particularly interested in the Credit Swap trading platform that Enron has  recently started. Such a platform will provide unique visibility into the Credit  markets. As you suggested I tried to learn more about this from Tanya. I  would like to learn more and if possible meet other people more directly linked  to the effort.         Just simple  instruments like Credit Swaps will require serious modelling capability for the  pricing and the hedging of these apparently simple intruments. The market  visibility I mention above can be explored through Credit Derivatives Trading  successfully if Enron possesses superior (vis a vis Morgan Stanley, Salomon  Smith Barney, Chase Manhatan, etc.) modelling technology in Credit  Derivatives. I can and would like to consider the possibility of doing this  for Enron. I would like to help develop and participate in putting together that  business.         As I  mentioned to you I have done some work in Credit Derivatives and am deeply  familiar with virtually all the work of the principal academics in Credit  Derivatives namely: Duffie, Lando, Tuffano, Duffee, Das, Lelland, etc. I have  read carefully most of their work (published as well as working papers) on the  subject to date.         I look  forward to hearing from you.         Best  regards          Joao",0

However, I appreciate you volunteering to potentiallyhaving been on such a round table discussion.I've been teaching a ""real options"" course that has the students performingmonte carlo analysis, Black-Scholes pricing, and binomial pricing alongwith a heavy dosage of understanding risk neutral pricing.  A few of yournew hires from the undergraduate program will be coming from this course.However, I have a student who will be finishing his MBA next spring that isparticularly good.  He is genuinely interested and curious about optionpricing, trading, and hedging with Excel/VBA skills.  In fact, he usuallyfigures out when I make even very small mistakes in my calculations.This is not to say that some of my other students aren't very talentedthemselves, but that this person really stands out.  Do you think youand/or Enron would be interested in such a person?  If so, what do yourecommend that he do to get his foot in the door?His intention is to finish the MBA, but I do not know if this wouldpreclude you from hiring or at least taking a look at him now.

Their so-called trading system is actually a scheduling system.My impression is that Jacob is good at selling himself, his knowledgeof finance and derivatives is very limited. Zimin---------------------- Forwarded by Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT on 04/11/2001 03:31 PM ---------------------------Chonawee Supatgiat@ENRON03/21/2001 07:28 PMTo:	Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:	Tom Halliburton/Corp/Enron@Enron Subject:	Jacob feedbackI asked Jacob two questions to check his basic knowledge. He answered correctly in the optimization question so I believe that he has a good foundation on his optimization skill. I have a doubt about his stochastic skill because he took only one course in Stochastic Processes and his previous models are simple deterministic models. If we had more interview time I would be able to check his stochastic and modeling skills.He completely failed to answer the second question, which is to check his basic risk management skill. It is clear to me that he has a very weak background in finance and risk management. He does not understand the relationship between a discount rate and risk. He showed some weakness in annuity calculation. In conclusion, I feel that he has good basic in optimization but a very weak background in finance. Based on his experiences, I have a doubt on his advance optimization skills, such as his stochastic skill and his ability to attack a complex optimization problem. I would recommend a second-round interview if he will be solving a complex-optimization problem. -Chonawee",0

"Chonawee,As I have pointed out, short-selling the stock may be a bad decision because of tax implications (ignoring the legal aspects).Suppose the strike is $70 and you were granted an ATM option.You  sell short at $70 ten lots (one lot  = 100 shares). The price goes to $100.  You lose $30 x 1000 = $30,000 on your short position. Option exercise gives you $30,000. This is before taxes. You pay taxeson your option income (it's treated as ordinary income). The tax is28% x $30,000 = $8,400. You can use only $3,000 of your loss againstordinary income. This saves you only $840 in taxes. Of course, if you have capital gains, you can use losses on your option positionas an offset.The remaining part of your capital loss  is carried forward and you get thetax benefits over time (less the time value of money), assuming you have income in thefuture (or capital gains).Not so good.By the way, valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock optionsis a very interesting and difficult problem.VinceChonawee Supatgiat@ENRON07/10/2000 11:40 AMTo: Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: short-sell vs exerciseBelow is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere. It explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised but cannot be sold. (As we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call option before its maturity). However, after taking Vince's comments on the ordinary income/capital loss TAX offsetting issue, I think this is not a good article anymore. I guess I could just throw this article away. :-)-chonaweeShort-selling is better than exercising your employee stock optionsIn general, the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when you speculate that ENE is going down or its growth rate is extremely low. In fact, when exercising the options, you are speculating that ENE would never reach this point (plus interest) again during the 10 years maturity date or until you leave the company. If you do not anticipate that, you should hold on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your exercise.However, if you believe that ENE is reaching its peak. Then, instead of exercising the options, you should short-sell (or sell) the stocks in that amount. After short-selling, when you feel that the stock starts to go up, you can buy them back (to cover), make profit, and still keep the options. On the other hand, if the stock does not go down as expect, you can exercise the options to cover your short position anytime. Let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes, no dividends, and zero risk-free rate. Suppose that ENE follows a simple sample path as followIf you exercise 100 ENE options with a grant price of 45 when ENE reaches 70, you would earn  (70-45)*100 = $2,500. But if you short sell 100 ENE at 70, no matter how much ENE is in the future, you can exercise the options to cover the short position and still earn (70-45)*100 = $2,500. The advantage of short-selling comes when ENE at the period 2 is 60. At this point, you can cover your short position, get (70-60)*100 = $1,000, and still keep your options or you can exercise the options and gain $2,500. That is, you still keep the flexibility of your options when you short-sell. In conclusion, the only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your short position.",0

"Hi Vince,I am enclosing a report on my thoughts about risk and return behaviour of an  insurance portfolio. Your input on this will be very helpful. I have given Vasant a copy of this report and am working with him towards improving  this. In the mean time, I happened to mention this idea in a meeting with David  Porter, Per Sekse, Brad Blesie and David Hoog and there seems to be some  interest in understanding how this works. In fact, David Hoog subsequently  reviewed this with me and suggested some changes. Those changes have been included in this report.The idea here is simple and just a starting point.  While it provides a broad picture on how risk and return will behave at portfolio level,  I am hoping to be able to relax some of the assumptions to get more realistic picture in near future.Looking forward to your input,Sincerely,Amitava",0
"Folks,As a follow-up to Scott Neal's inquiry this morning concerning portable/floating LNG opportunities for California, I have learned that no such capability currently exists.According to Todd Peterson of Enron Global LNG, exploitation of this opportunity has been the topic of some industry articles but no one, as far as we know, hasconstructed such a vessel.  I did come across a proposed design for an LNG floating terminal by the Italian company,Tecnomare.   I contacted them and they indicated that  they have notbuilt such a vessel.  It is estimated that construction of such a vessel would take 2-3 years, and as one might imagine, achieving the required operational and environmental performance in such a vessel would be quite substantial.

"SURVEY FINDS PRODUCERS PLAN TO SPEND MORE THAN ORIGINALLY PLANNED IN 2000     06/19/2000  Petroleum Finance Week  (c) 2000 Phillips Business Information, Inc.  Oil and gas producers plan to increase their worldwide exploration and production expenditures by more than they anticipated at the beginning of the year, Lehman Brothers Inc. found in a mid-year update of its annual E&P survey. ""The 326 companies we surveyed are planning on an 18.2 percent increase, versus a 10.2 percent rise budgeted in December,"" said James D. Crandell, who follows oil services and drilling for the New York investment banker. He emphasized that the gain by the 326 producers in Lehman's survey reflects increases in budgets for 2000 and not underspending of budgets during 1999. ""Among the companies that were included in our December 1999 and May 2000 surveys, global spending actually came in slightly above what was estimated to have been spent during 1999 in December. It also indicates that nearly $6 billion has been added to 2000 worldwide exploration budgets since December,"" Crandell said. The survey's respondents said that they planned to increase U.S. E&P expenditures by 17.6 percent, up from 15.9 percent earlier in the year. Crandell said that the greater increase was driven almost entirely by independent producers. ""In our survey, 227 independents indicated E&P spending growth in 2000 of 26.1 percent versus a 22.9 percent increase budgeted for the year in December,"" he indicated. ""Some 40 percent of the independents we surveyed have increased their U.S. E&P budgets, while about 23 percent plan on spending less than what they indicated last December. Higher natural gas prices and increased cash flow are the main drivers behind this."" Crandell said that Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: APC), Apache Corp. (NYSE: APA), BHP Petroleum, H.S. Resources Inc. (NYSE: HSE), McMoRan Exploration Co. (NYSE: RAN), MDU Resources Group Inc. (NYSE: MDU), Mitchell Energy and Development Corp. (NYSE: MND.A and MND.B), Santa Fe Snyder Corp. (NYSE: SFS), Stone Energy Corp. (NYSE: SGY) and Titan Exploration Inc. - now Pure Resources Inc. (NYSE: PRS) - were among the larger independents to make the most significant upward revisions. The ones that significantly reduced planned U.S. E&P outlays for the year included Barrett Resources Corp. (NYSE: BRR), Belco Oil and Gas Corp. (NYSE: BOG), Burlington Resources Inc. (NYSE: BR), Coastal Corp. (NYSE: CGP), Forcenergy Inc. (NYSE: FEN), Houston Exploration Co. (NYSE: HEX), Kerr-McGee Corp. (NYSE: KMG), Mariner Energy Corp. and Williams Production Co. The survey found that major oil companies plan about the same percentage gain in their 2000 U.S. E&P expenditures (8.8 percent) at midyear as they did at the beginning of the year (8.4 percent). Among the 14 companies in this category, 31 percent made meaningful increases in their 2000 E&P spending estimates during the first six months, including Amerada Hess Corp. (NYSE: AHC), Conoco Inc. (NYSE: COC.A and COC.B), Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: OXY)and Total Fina Elf S.A. (NYSE: TOT). Another 19 percent - including ENI SpA (NYSE: E), Royal Dutch/Shell (NYSE: RDP and STT) and Texaco Inc. (NYSE: TX) - scaled back their domestic spending estimates, while the remaining 50 percent of the majors in the survey remained the same. 'The increase in Canada... is nothing short of staggering...' ""The increase in Canada indicated by the 85 companies in our survey is nothing short of staggering,"" Crandell continued. Of the 85 companies that he contacted, 44.7 percent budgeted higher expenditures for 2000 than for 1999. ""Compared with December, 41 percent of them have increased their estimated spending in 2000 by more than 10 percent, while 20 percent have reduced it by more than 10 percent. The remaining 39 percent have kept it within 10 percent of what was originally estimated,"" Crandell said. Talisman Energy Inc. (NYSE: TLM) led the group with a huge increase, followed by Anderson Exploration Ltd. (TSE: AXL), Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. (NYSE: GOU), Murphy Oil Corp. (NYSE: MUR), Pan Canadian Petroleum Ltd. (TSE: PCP) and Shell Canada Ltd. (TSE: SHC). Like their U.S. counterparts, producers above the border raised their 2000 E&P budgets in response to higher gas prices and increased cash flow, according to the Lehman analyst. He said that foreign upstream budgets were an area of surprise: ""The 14.9 percent gain indicated by the 99 oil and gas companies that have operations outside the United States and Canada was well above the 5.7 percent increase for 2000 estimated last December. As in other geographies, there were more companies that increased budgets than decreased them."" Overall, Crandell said that 33 percent of the surveyed companies raised their 2000 E&P budgets by more than 10 percent, 43 estimated expenditures in roughly the same range and 24 percent indicated that they would spend less than originally planned. He said that the larger increases were driven by some big companies which materially increased their budgets, including Texaco, Petroleos Brasileiros S.A., Petroleos Mexicanos S.A. and Repsol YPF S.A. (NYSE: REP) among the multinationals and Amerada Hess, Apache, Premier Oil Plc. and Woodside Energy among mid-sized companies. Crandell noted that while respondents' average price assumptions rose during 2000's first six months (to $22.04 from $19.25 per barrel of crude oil and to $2.58 from $2.38 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas), they still trail current prices and what Lehman Brothers estimates for the year ($28 per barrel of crude and $3.30 per Mcf of gas). ""This suggests a stronger second half than expected, should companies raise budgets further to reflect the higher prices,"" he said. - Nick Snow in Washington---------------------- Forwarded by John Peyton/HOU/ECT on 06/19/2000 07:36 PM ---------------------------djcustomclips@djinteractive.com on 06/19/2000 08:27:26 PMPlease respond to nobody@mail1.djnr.comTo: 1346@WCTOPICS.djnr.comcc:  Subject: Energy: Oil Drilling: SURVEY FINDS PRODUCERS PLAN TO SPEND MORE THAN ORIGINALLY PLANNED IN ...SURVEY FINDS PRODUCERS PLAN TO SPEND MORE THAN ORIGINALLY PLANNED IN2000  Oil and gas producers plan to increase their worldwide exploration andproduction expenditures by more than they anticipated at the beginningof theyear, Lehman Brothers Inc. found in a mid-year update of its annual E&Psurvey.

"The following report contains confidential and sensitive information.  Please treat with discretion.Executive Summary:?	FERC price cap decision reflects Bush political and economic objectives. Politically, Bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on Davis; from an economic perspective, he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation?	Davis finds four major flaws with FERC plan, most notably its exclusion of out-of-state generators?	June 1st ""kill clause"" for FERC order could coincide with new Bush regional plan?	California facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade, expected $20 billion power bill this summer--economic crisis would force deeper Administration involvement?	QF bid for advance payments from PG&E likely to fail in bankruptcy court?	New generation delays probable because of State/QF squabbling?	Consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to SoCal bailout deal1.	FERC FalloutThe FERC decision is a holding move by the Bush administration that looks like action, but is not.  Rather, it allows the situation in California to continue to develop virtually unabated.  The political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where Davis cannot escape shouldering the blame.  Once they are politically inoculated,  the Administration can begin to look at regional solutions.  Moreover, the Administration has already made explicit (and will certainly restate in the forthcoming Cheney commission report) its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation.It is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the FERC order and that the only FERC commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan. 2.	Something Less than Effective Price Caps From Davis's point of view, the FERC plan has four major flaws:?	The order applies only to California, not to the rest of the west. Non-California generators are not required to sell at capped rates to California.?	As the order is written, it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling.?	State officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system, because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a Stage 2 emergency and does not require any collusion.?	Even when the price caps kick in, they are based on the cost-plus for the highest cost producer supplying power to California and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap.  The generators can also charge above the cap, provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to FERC.3.	Proposal ""Kill Clause"" Adds to the Political Dilemma for DavisThe FERC proposal includes a ""kill clause"" that says the caps will be withdrawn unless California's ISO agrees by June 1st to become part of the regional grid now under FERC control.  If Davis doesn't sign on to the regional grid by June 1st, then he will have to live with June 2nd headlines blaming him for letting the ""Bush price caps plan"" collapse.4.	Growing Fiscal Risk in CaliforniaSources speculate that California  could therefore pay as much as $20 billion on power this summer - this is more  than the combined enterprise value of PG&E and SCE.  These sources believe that, because of the severity of the situation, the FERC and/or the  federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for  power.The consensus is that the state of California will run out of money in about 90 days. One of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for long-term power deals.  The bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to California.The Bush Administration and the Fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture.  The country's largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months.5.	QFs to Seek Advance Payment from PG&EMeanwhile, on the bankruptcy front, the QFs reportedly  will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from PGE's  accounts, since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment  for gas. It appears very unlikely that the QFs' request will be granted. If the  QFs do not receive advance payment, it is likely that most of the 4,000 mw  of gas-fired QF capacity will remain offline. 6	Delays Likely in New QF GenerationThe QF deals made with the state for long-term contracts are  being continually renegotiated, which is likely to mean that the new plants  those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as  anticipated.7.	Consumer Groups Ready to Challenge Constitutionality of SCE Bailout PlanHarvey  Rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis  of the MOU for the SCE bailout  plan.  The analysis was done by a  utilities analyst, rather than a lawyer, though it appears to raise a number of  good legal points. For example, one of the elements of the MOU is a ""non-bypassable"" charge  on ratepayers that would require  them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid. This is effectively a tax,  since there is no exchange of value  for money, which under the CA constitution cannot be used to directly  benefit a private entity.  This makes  the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds, rather than revenue  bonds. According to the constitution, the state cannot be put into debt to  benefit a private company.  For this and other reasons, even if the  Republicans would vote for the SCE bailout, which remains  unlikely, the bailout probably would not  stand a likely constitutional challenge.  8.	Governor Hurt by Continued Failure to Disclose Long-Term Power ContractsThe issue of the Governor's failure to  disclose the details of the long-term power  contracts continues to  distress the other players in the  crisis.  Even if he were to  disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating, it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged, creating an even further delay.  ",0

"Attached is a draft of the Vega VaR implement documentation.  We will discuss this issue tomorrow.Index VaR and the Vega VaR status:Because any modification of the VaR model has to be coded into the new version by IT,  the Index VaR model and the Vega VaR model are on the waiting list to get into  IT group's door.  Currently, they are struggling with the Credit Model.  Accord to Jonathan Le, they will implement the ""Prudency"" model after the ""Credit"" and before anything else.  So, it's uncertain when they can begin these two projects.Credit Reserve Model status:New version developed by IT is still in the debugging stage.  Two major difference exist between the new and old versions:1)  Old version uses delta-gammar methodology, new version uses full evaluation.  IT group is not comfortable with their implementation of the ""Spread option"" and ""Swaption"" evaluation.  I am working with them on it.2) Insurance projects are new to the new version.  IT also wants our help too.Only after the IT finishes the debugging process, could we start testing the new version with the current one.Thanks.Vincent",0

One problem on that front is still how much producers want to charge the state for electricity. As we reported last week, Davis and his aides  want to pay around $50 to $55 dollars per megawatt hour and suppliers want about $75. Treasury Secretary Summers has suggested an auction as the best way to  determine the price, but California officials are taking a less free market approach and still hope to set the price through negotiation over long-term contracts.Our sources in Washington, Sacramento, and California are increasingly of the view that Governor Davis is positioning his government to establish long-term power contracts with the generators that could be passed through to the utilities following a bankruptcy in the near term.  This week's legislative activitiesin Sacramento will create the vehicle to do so.   State credit backing purchases of power would obviate the need for super-priority borrowing to finance power purchases after utility bankruptcy.1. Audit- Untangling Utility RelationshipsCalifornia officials have also toughened their rhetoric on the debt repayment front as they say results from a preliminary audit show that half of the $9 to $12 billion  the utilities say they owe is actually owed to themselves for power they bought from their corporate relationsThis strange situation is due to the fact that one holding company owns both the power-generating and power-distributing companies under a holding company umbrella. Of course, that means that some of the power PG&E and Southern California Edison bought at highly inflated prices was bought from themselves.   But it was not all bad news in the tense negotiations. Sources confirm that Davis increasingly understood that the state finance role was a crucial part of any potential solution. He told our sources this afternoon that he is willing to use state credit to eliminate the ""risky debt"" premium that PG&E and SCE are being charged by suppliers because of their shaky finances and that he is willing to extend the current 10% rate increase utility customers are paying far beyond the initial 90-day deadline. In return he is demanding that the companies prepare to ""share the burden of debt reduction in return for state help and credit extension.""2. Debt Restructuring- Guarantees, but No Direct State Money Davis also told the videoconference that he believes the $12 billion in back debt owed by the utility companies can be cleared upduring a 90-day forbearance period (whether that period has been agreed to by all creditors is not something we are clear about right now). Davis' idea, ashe laid it out in the meeting, is to use the forbearance period to securitize the debts and sell them against the utilities' forward rate base or by establishing amedium-term repayment plan backed by continued state guarantees.  In both cases the restructured debt would be resolved over a decade without direct use of taxpayer money as the utilities use their positive margins topaydown their debt. One of the reasons Davis wants to stay close to the $50-$55 megawatt charge is that it maximizes the rate at which utilities can paydown this debt. There is a strong chance that Davis will agree to use state guarantees to sweeten the pot at the end of these negotiations, but he remainsopposed to using direct state money. This frustrates both Clinton administration and utility creditors, but Davis has not yet shown much flexibility.3. Eminent Domain/Reregulation  Perhaps most frustrating to the Washington DC free market crowd at Treasury and the White House was the continued comfort Davis and his group of political  advisers have with ""non-market"" solutions to the energy crisis. Although the Governor's aides actually believe the weapon is more a ""way to force eventual  agreement, than an actual solution,"" the talk returns frequently to these non-market mechanisms. ""We have the ultimate weapon to enforce compliance by the  Tuesday deadline. If we make no progress. If this thing looks like it will turn into a genuine crisis, then we will use our powers of condemnation and we will re-take  the plants and equipment and run them ourselves,"" a close political aide to Davis said. ""We will absorb the plants, the transmission lines and the reserved parking  places of the executives. The legislature would agree in a second.""",0

"Dear Generation/Power Marketing Executive:This Alliance Info Alert includes three items of interest:1)  The weekly Alliance Express newsletter2)  Listing of recent filings at FERC3)  Timeline for FERC action on California Markets  (attached)                       Alliance of Energy Suppliers ExpressDecember 19, 2000INSIDE WASHINGTON   FEDERAL AFFAIRS***FERC De-Federalizes California Markets, Adopts Other Structural Reforms***At a special meeting Friday afternoon, FERC unanimously approved its eagerly awaited final order reforming the California wholesale markets, adopting the major outlines of its November 1 proposed order and sending back to California the responsibility for addressing state-related matters.  At the same time, FERC deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as well as the imposition of region-wide price caps.  FERC reiterated their earlier conclusions that under certain circumstances, California ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to California's ""seriously flawed"" market structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the West.FERC adopted the November proposal to eliminate, effective immediately, the state's mandatory requirement that the state's investor-owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the PX, and allow these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks.  FERC terminated the PX's rate schedules effective at the close of business on April 30, 2001.  In effect, as Chairman James Hoecker stated, the order de-federalizes 60 percent of the California wholesale market established under the state's restructuring law, returning ratemaking authority over company-owned generation to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).The agency also modified the effective period of the $150/MWh ""soft cap"" proposal, limiting its application through April 2001, whereupon a ""comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which incorporates appropriate thresholds, screen and mitigation measures"" must be in place.  In a related move, FERC ordered a technical conference early next year to develop such a program by March 1, 2001, so that these measures can be place by the May 1, deadline.***Energy Secretary Issues Order to Power Generators and Marketers To Bolster California's Supplies***Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has responded to the severely constrained power supply situation in California by issuing an order, pursuant to Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, to require generators and marketers to make power available to meet the state's electricity needs.  The emergency directive requires that, if the California independent system operator (ISO) certifies that there is an inadequate supply of electricity, certain suppliers would be required to make power available to the ISO if they have power available in excess of the amount needed to satisfy service to firm customers. Those suppliers that have provided power to the California power exchange (PX) and the ISO over the last 30 days that have firm capacity available would be subject to the order.Under the order, the ISO is required to provide notice to each supplier subject to the order of the amount and type of service requested by 9:00 pm EST on the day before the requested service.  The ISO must, to the extent feasible, allocate the requests in proportion to the amount of each supplier's available power.  The price for the power provided pursuant to the order will be set by an agreement between the ISO and the supplier.  If no agreement is reached, FERC is to determine the just and reasonable rate at a later date.   The order will remain in effect until 3:00 am EST on December 21, 2000 unless modified.***EPA Sets Plans to Regulate Plants' Mercury Emissions***EPA Administrator Carol Browner, in a long-awaited announcement, indicated last week that the Administration will require reductions of mercury emissions from coal- and oil-fired power plants.  The agency stated that it plans to propose new regulations in December 2003, and hopes to finalize new rules by December 2004.In the wake of the decision, EEI called on EPA to make certain that any program to control utilities' mercury emissions be based on the best scientific information available in order to assure the protection of public health.  ""EEI urges EPA to maintain its commitment to resolving the key scientific and technological issues,"" said Paul Bailey, EEI Vice President, Environmental Affairs.  Given these uncertainties, EEI is disappointed that the regulatory determination includes statements regarding public health threats and hazards that are unsupported by current science,"" said Mr. Bailey.""In the meantime, the electric power industry will continue to work with all stakeholders to determine the extent to which additional mercury reductions from power plants may be needed, and how those cuts should be achieved,"" Mr. Bailey concluded.MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS ***Calpine Completes Acquisition of EMI Power Assets***Calpine Corporation has announced that it has completed the acquisition of power assets from Energy Management, Inc. (EMI).  In the deal, Calpine acquired the remaining interest in three recently constructed, combined-cycle power generating facilities located in New England, as well as a joint marketing venture between Calpine and EMI.  Prior to the transaction, Calpine held a 50 percent net interest in the projects.""We are very pleased to have completed the acquisition of these new and highly efficient power plants.  The Dighton, Tiverton, and Rumford facilities were among the first merchant power plants to enter commercial operation in New England,"" said Calpine Senior Vice President Bob Alff.  ""Combined with our other announced project in the Northeast, we have created a coordinated system of low-cost assets, with excellent geographic diversity, to provide power to a very attractive New England market,"" added Alff.***Exelon Completes Acquisition of 49.9 Percent of Sithe***Exelon Corporation and Sithe Energies have announced the completion of Exelon's acquisition of 49.9 percent of the stock of Sithe.  The completion of the acquisition finalizes an agreement in which PECO Energy Company agreed to purchase 49.9 percent of Sithe's assets in North America for $682 million.  PECO has since merged with Unicom Corporation to form Exelon Corporation.Under the terms of the agreement, Exelon has the option to purchase the remaining 50.1 percent of Sithe within two to five years at a price based on prevailing market conditions when the purchase option is exercised.  Exelon and Sithe will continue to operate independently, said the companies.ENERGY DATA*** Weekly Electric Output (Week 50)***Electric output reached 74,737 GWh for the week ending December 9 (Week 50), with the highest increase over 1999 levels in the Mid-Atlantic region, which had a 15.8 percent increase over 1999.

"Andy,The scale effect in the transport model can be explained. I use a European option to do the illustration.I raise the underlying and strike price by the same amount, use the fuel percentage to adjust the strike.The net result is the intrinsic value decreases as the level goes up.If the fuel percentage is not very high, the option premium actually increases with the level, although theintrinsic value decreases.  If the fuel percentage is very high (8%), then we see a decreasing option price.In the transport deal, fuel change is often below 5%, so you will not see a decreasing spread option pricewhen NYMEX moves up.  So I think the transport model still does what it should do.ZiminIn the following exmaple, I used r=6%, vol=20%, T=100days, see spreadsheet for details. ---------------------- Forwarded by Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT on 10/20/2000 01:24 PM ---------------------------Zimin Lu10/20/2000 10:45 AMTo: Andrew H Lewis/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Colleen Sullivan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: level effect in transportAndy,The following spread sheet domenstrates the leve effect in transport valuation.I add an ""NYMEX add-on"" to both delivery and receipt price curve before fueladjustment, keep everything else the same.

"Jason,After our brief discussion last night I think I should discuss a few of the issues I have with respect to calculating a VaR on the deal that you are proposing.  The VaR model, as I illustrated, is set up to accept a term structure of delta positions, prices and vols and it may be difficult to translate the 'silver mine' position into these inputs. I do not think that we can simply take the net silver content of the mine and then make some assumptions about vol and price. The VaR model also assumes a certain amount of liquidity in the market and a 1 day holding period. To do this properly I would need to understand fully how the deal is priced as these sensitivities are ultimately what will effect the change in MTM in the future and that is essentially what VaR is supposed to predict.If you need me to work on this then you need to contact Steve who will help to prioritise my time. I will also need to consult with Vince Kaminski and Tanya Tamarachenko in Houston for advice.RAC will also assist in the process.Please contact me if you have any further questions,Kirsteex34529",0
"Hi,I have run the VaR with updated factor loadings for the gold,silver and cocoa bean positions. The biggest change in VaR from adding this information has been to the Cocoa bean position which has increased from approx $45,900 to $506,553.The overal VaR has not changed by very much as the position file I was sent from Andreas had not changed from the 26th - I have queried this and it will not be a problem to re-run the numbers on Monday if I recieve a further file.The VaR summary for all the metals is as follows :Also, after having a conversation with Bjorn about stress/scenario analysis I thought I might quickly try to set up a few scenarios to see how sensitive the VaR is to a position change in Aluminium, Nickel and Copper.I have only applied position increases (thge direction of the shifts are dependent on the monthly outright position direction) up until Dec2000.The shifts and results are given in the following attached spreadsheet.  It is interesting that the individual VaR's are particuarly sensitive to increasing the position for Nickel.I would like to discuss these results on Monday and any further suggestions for senarios would also be gratefully recieved.Have a good weekend,Kirstee.",0
"Gentlemen,Below is a plan of action for moving along with the VaR methodology change related to forward-forward volatility:1. Finalize the methodology proposed (Research/Market Risk) - determine the time period used to calculated forward-forward vols vs. correlations (20 days vs. 60 days) - stabilize the calculation for curves and time periods where the curve does not change based on historical prices, implying volatility of 0%2. Get approval for the methodology change from Rick Buy (see draft of the memo attached) - John Lavorato and John Sherriff3. Develop and implement the new methodology in a stage environment (Research/IT)4. Test the new methodology (Market Risk, Traders)5. Migrate into production (Research/IT)Please let me know if this is reasonable and meets everyone's expectations. Vlady.",0
"Dear Andreas,Thanks for the very useful response and information on positions.  I have handed over primary responsibility for metals VaR to Kirstee Hewitt (at least as far as London is concerned) and she will follow up on the points you kindly reported, although I am of course available to assist where necessary.  Tanya will remain the point of contact for VaR modelling in Houston, and of course Kirstee and Tanya will work together on this to resolve these and further issues.  I would be happy to help set up meetings for you in the London office when you visit next week, with Kirstee, myself and anyone else that you would like to meet with and we very much look forward to your visit - please let me know if you need any help with the arrangements.Regards,Anjam0207 783 5383---------------------- Forwarded by Anjam Ahmad/LON/ECT on 27/07/2000 08:40 ---------------------------   	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

Wolff quantities. Thispositions are imputed into the system at their integrity (some legs/hedgesare missing)This affects copper and Lead position for now. The issues should be havebeen sorted out by the end of this month, ie next week. So in Copper youhave 25,487 mt to much and with Lead you have 13,579mt to much.(as of June19)2) Looking at copper position you calculate a VAR of -3,100,568 with atotal outright of 63.765 mt.This seams too low. if I calculate 63765 x 1807 x3.99%=4.218 mil. US$. VAR(outright qty x price levelx risk factor, riskfactr as per Mercur).In my view we have been understating VaR in Mercur because we do notconsider the spread position correctly (i.e. in detail). On a position likethat I would expect a figure of around 6 mil US$.I guess the issue is in the volatility and in the holding period.3) your correlation matrix for the commodities is not final i assume asmany fields are blank.Lets talk tomorrow on the phone.Attached please find the Position summary for the last week #30 (since June19) as requested by Kirstee.(See attached file: mgposw30.xls)Andreas BarschkisMG Metal & Commodity Corp.520 Madison Avenue, 28th FloorNew York, NY 10022Tel: +1.212.715.5628Cel: +1.917.679.8287Fax: +1.212.715.5608E-mail: andreas.barschkis@mgusa.com                    Anjam.Ahmad@e                    nron.com             To:     Andreas.Barschkis@mgusa.com                                         cc:     Kirstee.Hewitt@enron.com                    07/26/2000           Subject:     Zipped VARMODEL_Live.XLS                    11:37 AMHi Andreas,This is the semi-final spreadsheet - have only to include price curves forGold and cocoa.

Basically it suggests that the copper option position may well have increased the VaR by more than $500,000.

The delta is 35299$/mt for Dec 2000. The Cu VaR has gone up from $2,245,000 to $3,306,000. I estimated that the portfolio for the 1st would increase to approx $3,039,000 so this seems sensible. The overall VaR change is from $4,780,796 to $5,991,569. Again, the estimate for the 1st Aug was for an increase in VaR to ~ $5,476,000.All estimates were based on a delta of 32,0004/dmt.There has also been some increase in the VaR for Aluminium which will effect the overall total.A summary is as follows : regards,Kirstee",0

"Kevin, the memo looks good.  One suggestion I have is to emphasize what we can deliver by end of January since that was the initial deadline.  Although the memo indicates that a lot of work has been done, the reader might want to know what he can get in his hand in terms of models or quantitative results.  You will of course describe everything in your presentation, but given that setting up presentations may take time, you should think about creating some template/model and send it with brief explanations.  For example, a template for TRS as it stands, and a template listing trigger events and how the results will be displayed.  You can then expand on this in your presentations.Vasant",0

Emshwiller, Rebecca Smith and Jathon Sapsford10/26/2001The Wall Street JournalC1(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available bank credit lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liquidity. Enron will use part of the money to offer to redeem about $1.85 billion of outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- according to a person familiar with the matter, with the remainder providing the energy concern with a cash cushion. Some observers believe the move is a pre-emptive step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted. The person also said Enron was talking to its banks about a new, multibillion-dollar credit line.Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong. But, ""when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last few days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank,"" said an Enron spokesman. In a statement, the company's new chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, ""we are making it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments."" The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the Houston energy-trading concern in the past 10 days. Enron is the nation's largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all electricity and natural-gas trades. Yesterday, for example, Enron was involved in about $4 billion of deals through its EnronOnline unit. Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. Last week, it reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was replaced Wednesday. The draw-down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency, Fitch, put Enron on review for a possible downgrade, while another, Standard & Poor's, changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investors Service already has said it is looking at a possible downgrade of Enron. In order to fall below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have to fall several notches. If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. Together with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment-grade rating would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue millions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of existing shares. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron was down six cents at $16.35. Liquidity is a key issue for Enron, which handles energy-trading volumes more than triple its next-biggest competitor, American Electric Power Co. Enron's EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform has transacted more than $884 billion of trades since it was created in November 1999. The company's wildly successful wholesale unit has been dragged down by underperforming assets elsewhere in the company, chiefly the approximately $6.5 billion of international assets such as its Dabhol power project in India. Raising cash and retiring debt largely is a timing issue. The cash needs of its trading operation are immediate; it takes time to sell assets, particularly in today's slower economy. The company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies that have damaged its credibility, particularly in connection with its dealings with Mr. Fastow, the former chief financial officer. Internal documents related to one of the Fastow partnerships disclose that Enron also did as much as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected to another company official, who has since left Enron. While Enron disclosed its Fastow-related transactions in SEC filings, a computerized search of the SEC's database of public filings produced no reference to this other employee-related entity known as Chewco. Chewco was established in 1997 ""with approximately $400 million in capital commitments"" to buy an interest in Enron assets, according to one of the partnerships documents. The document didn't further specify what assets were purchased, and it didn't disclose the financial impact of the transactions for either Chewco or Enron. Chewco was being run by Michael Kopper, a managing director in Enron's Global Equity Markets Group, according to the document. Enron, which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with employee-related entities were legal and properly disclosed, didn't have any comment regarding its dealings with Chewco. Mr. Kopper, who Enron says left the company this year to focus on helping to run the Fastow-related partnerships, didn't return phone calls. A person at his office in Houston yesterday said Mr. Kopper was traveling. In response to questions about Chewco, an Enron spokesman would say only that ""Michael Kopper was never an executive officer of Enron."" Mr. Fastow repeatedly has declined interview requests. He severed his relationships with the partnerships in July. This statement is an apparent reference to SEC disclosure regulations regarding related-party transactions. Under SEC rule S-K, a company has to report any transaction that exceeds $60,000 and involves ""any director or executive officer."" By contrast, Mr. Fastow, as CFO, would have fallen into that category, but Mr. Kopper, as managing director of a business unit, presumably wouldn't have. However, reporting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board seems to have a broader definition, one that might include Mr. Kopper. According to FAS Statement 57, a related-party transaction involves a ""material"" piece of business between the company and a member of management. The statement defines management as directors, top officers, vice presidents in charge of major business units and ""other persons who perform similar policy-making functions. Persons without formal titles may also be members of management.""Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 	Deals & Deal Makers: Enron Officials Sell Shares Amid Stock-Price SlumpBy Theo Francis and Cassell Bryan-LowStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal10/26/2001The Wall Street JournalC14(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)Officials at Enron Corp., whose unusual transactions with its chief financial officer are under regulatory scrutiny, have steadily sold sizable amounts of their holdings of company stock as the share price has fallen this year. Corporate officials had sold 1.8 million shares valued at about $106 million through July, as the stock fell to less than $45 a share from $83 at the start of the year. Since July, the stock has plummeted an additional 63% to $16.35, including a 50% plunge since the beginning of last week.Kenneth Lay, chief executive of the Houston energy-trading company, cashed in shares for $25.7 million so far this year, usually in transactions paired with options exercises. He sold 429,614 shares, leaving him with some 2.8 million shares as of July, the latest data available on his sales, according to Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics. The dollar amount for his 2001 sales is approaching the total for all Mr. Lay's sales of Enron shares for 2000, which reached $30.7 million. In 1999, he sold shares for a total of $26 million. In Houston, an Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on the figures, saying the company doesn't keep a running tally of stockholdings by corporate officials. Enron also wouldn't comment on the number of options held by company insiders and called the sales ""a personal decision."" Many sales by Enron insiders were concurrent with options exercises or sales followed soon after option exercises. Strong selling by company officers and directors amid share-price declines should raise red flags for investors, says Jonathan Moreland, research director of InsiderInsights.com, who uses insider-trading data to zero in on investment ideas. Among other insiders selling during the year, Kenneth Rice, former chairman and CEO of Enron's broadband unit, sold shares for $23.7 million. Mr. Rice has sold 456,966 shares of the 1.5 million shares he was listed as owning in Enron's March proxy filing. Former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling -- who resigned in August -- sold 160,000 shares for $9.8 million during the year. In March, Mr. Skilling owned 1.9 million shares. Messrs. Rice and Skilling couldn't be reached to comment. Overall, Enron's insiders were busier selling shares last year, when they sold 5.8 million shares for about $449 million. During 1999, insiders sold 3.4 million shares for $123.1 million. Since December 1999, only one Enron executive has reported buying company shares. The buyer was Andrew Fastow, who was ousted during the week as Enron's chief financial officer after the company disclosed it was under a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into financial ties between the company and Mr. Fastow. Mr. Fastow reported purchasing 10,000 Enron shares in August at $36.98 each, or a total of $369,800. Today, those shares are valued at $163,500, based on Enron's stock price of $16.35 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading. After the purchase, Mr. Fastow owned 110,586 shares, Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics says. Enron said Mr. Fastow wasn't available to comment. On Monday, a New York law firm filed suit in U.S. District Court in Houston, alleging that Enron misrepresented its performance by failing to disclose problems with its broadband division and failing to properly write down the value of investments in limited partnerships managed by Mr. Fastow. The suit, which seeks class-action status, also says Enron insiders sold $73 million of their own Enron holdings during parts of 2000 and 2001.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Credit MarketsEnron's Financial Troubles Reverberate to Bonds With Poor Liquidity and Credit-Rating ConcernsBy Jathon Sapsford and Suzanne McGeeStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal10/26/2001The Wall Street JournalC15(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW YORK -- Enron Corp.'s bonds have held up better than its battered stock amid escalating financial woes at the energy-trading powerhouse. Not for long, some bond traders say.In trading yesterday, the Houston company's five-year bond, a $250 million issue due in July 2006 carrying a coupon of 6.4%, was quoted at 82 cents on the dollar, down from a bid of 88 late Wednesday, and representing a 16% drop during the past two weeks. That is far less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct. 16 disclosure of a $1.01 billion charge linked to soured investments, resulting in a $618 million third-quarter loss. But the fall in the bond's price translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage points above bellwether U.S. government bonds, which is a widening from about three percentage points two weeks ago. Although Enron still is an investment-grade credit, that kind of ""spread"" is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of single B or lower. Enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound, disclosing late yesterday that it drew down more than $1 billion on its bank credit lines to shore up its finances. Yet even as Enron was tapping its lifeline, investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of Enron bonds. Yesterday's 82 bid, for instance, was for a block of less than $2 million in bonds, a small percentage of a typical trade. Fueling the uncertainty surrounding Enron were fears that credit-rating concerns will lower ratings on Enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of troubles, including losses, a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer. ""Even at these levels, there's very little buying interest,"" said Harold Rivkin, a principal at distressed-debt trader H. Rivkin & Co. in Princeton, N.J. In one sign of the ripple effects, the price investors pay to protect themselves from losses on Enron debt was surging. The cost of a ""default swap"" -- in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at face value in the event of default -- rose to 10% of the size of the credit being insured. That was up from 8% a day earlier, and more than holders of Lucent Technologies Inc. debt had to pay at the height of that technology company's troubles earlier during the year. Even with its woes, Enron remains an investment-grade company. Most credit-rating agencies rate Enron's senior unsecured debt at several notches above the noninvestment-grade level. Yet Fitch said yesterday it put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possible downgrade, following a similar move by Moody's Investors Service last week. (Standard & Poor's, a division of McGraw Hill Cos., stopped short of putting the company on its Creditwatch list, opting instead to revise its long-term ratings outlook to ""negative,"" citing concerns about the company's financial flexibility.) Meanwhile, the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for the worst. ""These are investment-grade bonds that are migrating toward distressed levels,"" said Glenn Reynolds, an analyst at Credit Sights Inc., an independent fixed-income research firm in New York. ""They aren't distressed yet, but they are headed in that direction."" If Enron's credit ratings fall, it would have implications far beyond the company's ability to raise money. For an energy trader, a credit downgrade sends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to make good on its commitments. Enron makes markets in a variety of commodities. Though it is best known for trading electricity and natural gas, the company also is a huge force in the markets for other commodities such as lumber, metals, bandwidth capacity and steel. As a market maker matching buyers and sellers, Enron handles about a quarter of all the trading in the nation's energy and gas markets. Enron's credit-worthiness is hugely important. The better its credit rating, the cheaper it can hedge, or offset, its positions in all these commodities markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers. Without that credit rating, the cost of this high-margin, high-volume business starts to rise. A derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to, or derived from, that of an underlying security or asset, such as a stock, bond or commodity. ""Even if the company does retain its investment-grade rating, the perception that this might be at risk will start to affect their core businesses,"" said Mr. Reynolds at Credit Sights Inc. ""Any prudent risk [manager] at Enron's counterparties"" -- any institution on the other end of a financial agreement with Enron -- ""is going to be examining their exposure to Enron, and looking for ways to minimize it or offset it,"" Mr. Reynolds said. To be sure, Enron, despite its recent woes, remains a strong company, credit analysts said. ""I don't think anyone's seriously thinking that this is a company that would ever default,"" Mr. Reynolds said. ""So far, our research shows that their counterparties and their banks are sticking with them,"" said Ron Barone, managing director of Standard & Poor's utility energy project finance group. ""No one has cut credit lines or asked for additional collateral that we have identified. And customers have publicly stated that it's business as usual."" Yet analysts say the arrival of distressed-debt traders on the scene could make life more difficult for Enron and its management. Traders expect Enron's new Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon and Chairman Kenneth Lay to make the rounds of Wall Street next week, meeting with rating agencies, debt-trading desks, big bond holders and banks, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. Treasurys Treasurys rallied on optimism that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates more than previously expected after a spate of economic reports that documented how weak the economy was after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Prices also gained as the market finished digesting the week's flood of Treasury, corporate and agency debt issues. At 4 p.m. EDT, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was up 13/32 point, or $4.0625 per $1,000 face value, at 103 20/32. Its yield fell to 4.537% from 4.588% Wednesday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year Treasury bond's price was up 22/32 point at 101 11/32 to yield 5.284%, down from 5.330% Wednesday. Fed policy makers are slated to meet on Nov. 6. Also providing support for longer maturities, the Treasury Department made another repurchase of issues outstanding. It received offers for $5.04 billion in callable 30-year bonds, of which it accepted $1 billion. The offer-to-cover ratio, an indication of demand, was 5.04.

Heard on the StreetMost Analysts Remain Plugged In to EnronBy Susanne Craig and Jonathan WeilStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal10/26/2001The Wall Street JournalC1(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)Enron: Rarely have so many analysts liked a stock they concede they know so little about. In recent years, Wall Street researchers have been overwhelmingly -- critics would say blindly -- enthusiastic about Enron, even as they acknowledge not always understanding the complex financial transactions that accounted for its soaring profits. Now, Enron is reporting steep losses from some of its most complicated transactions, which many on Wall Street still can't figure out.In a research note Wednesday, Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer conceded that scant corporate disclosure at the Houston energy trader makes it difficult to value the company. The company's ""lack of disclosure and transparency,"" he says, is ""a longstanding Enron hallmark."" So is this a stock to avoid, in his view? Hardly. Goldman on Wednesday did bump Enron off its ""U.S. Select List,"" which consists of a few dozen top stock picks -- but Mr. Fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm's larger but prestigious ""Recommended List"" of 200 or so favored stocks, where it has been since he joined Goldman in 1993. ""Just because I can't be specific in being able to create a simple model . . . doesn't mean that you write off that industry and say `I can't analyze it' or `I can't figure it out,' "" says Mr. Fleischer, who owns an undisclosed number of Enron shares. ""If that were the case, there would be an awful lot of industries we couldn't follow."" Enron's shares have dropped about 50% since last week. ""Every sell-side analyst we spoke to early in 2001 admitted that this was a black box,"" says Jim Chanos, principal of Kynikos Associates in New York, who has been selling Enron stock short -- trading it with an eye to profiting from its fall -- throughout this year. ""It was really a trust-me story, when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that level of trust."" True, no stock picker is immune from bad calls. And Wall Street analysts long have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias, particularly on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment-banking deals to be had. But Enron stands apart, precisely because so many of the analysts still recommending the stock have acknowledged that the company's disclosure practices are lacking. Which raises the question: How can an analyst recommend that others purchase a stock when key information about the company's operations is so often either unavailable or indecipherable? Concerns about the way that Enron runs its business aren't new. Many of the issues now plaguing Enron's stock were first raised more than a year ago by bearish hedge-fund managers and independent accounting experts. Yet time and again, Wall Street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the lingering questions about the company's various partnership transactions. Besides those partnerships, Enron also has been dogged by concerns about the secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings. Through it all, most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock-market darling, publicly dismissing questions about the firm's accounting practices and level of disclosure. As of yesterday, of the 17 analysts who following the stock, 10 had a ""strong buy"" or equivalent rating on the stock, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Five others rated the stock a ""buy,"" though not strongly. Only Prudential Securities, which downgraded the stock this week, has a ""sell"" rating on Enron. The bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high-profile examples of Wall Street taking a glass half-full stance, despite what in retrospect seems to be ample warning that a less-enthusiastic approach was warranted. Over the past year in the wake of the Nasdaq Composite Index's general collapse, analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence -- particularly those who, like Goldman's Mr. Fleischer, own shares in the companies they cover. Regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromised themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment-banking fees and other revenue. Enron has spread the wealth across many Wall Street firms. For instance, for one $865 million equity offering in 1999 led by `Credit Suisse First Boston, Enron retained seven co-managers, including Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch. ""Enron is a big company, and I don't think you're going to find a firm that hasn't been involved,"" says Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer, who still rates the stock a ""strong buy"" with a $40 price target. ""They pay a lot of investment-banking fees to Wall Street."" He adds, ""We do our analysis every day based on the information we have. Are we here strictly to defend companies? That's ludicrous. We're here to provide information to investors. . . . Yes, I have the wrong recommendation on the stock. I don't think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has performed."" Mr. Fleischer, whose firm also has served as an investment banker to Enron, calls his holding ""a meaningful investment"" that is ""not small."" But he disputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised. Mr. Fleischer says his clients ""are happy to know"" he has a stake in Enron, because it shows he puts his money where his mouth is. In his research note Wednesday, Mr. Fleischer called for complete disclosures of Enron's off-balance sheet partnerships. Despite the resulting difficulty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company, he wrote that he and many other investors historically ""have given Enron the benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings"" and position as an industry leader. ""There's not information to really model this and be able to predict accurately where revenues are going to come from and where they're going to make their money, but every quarter they do,"" he says. ""It's hard to get inside to know all the transactions, but they do deliver."" CSFB's Mr. Launer also has been a longtime defender of the company, occasionally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about Enron in the financial press. On Monday, he wrote that he expects questions about Enron's partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue, but that he remains ""confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for [Enron] and an ultimate recovery in the share price."" ""I know I'm wrong on the stock,"" Mr. Launer says. But he says that at these prices, he isn't ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even in a worst-case scenario -- under which he envisions Enron having to issue as much as $2 billion worth of shares, diluting current holders -- the stock doesn't have much further to fall. Clearly, Messrs. Launer and Flesicher aren't alone. ""Even in relative terms, analysts remain very bullish on this stock,"" says Chuck Hill, director of research at Thomson Financial/First Call. The average rating for a stock on Wall Street is 2.2, or slightly shy of a ""buy"" rating. Enron scores a 1.6. ""This may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad news is out,"" Mr. Hill says. In downgrading the stock this week, Prudential analyst Carol Coale bumped it to ""sell"" from ""buy,"" with a brief stop at ""hold."" While she is the only analyst to recommend investors sell the stock, she openly concedes her recent downgrades come ""too little, too late."" Ms. Coale says Enron has been difficult to cover for years. She says the company's disclosure practices fall far short of ideal, and senior executives are often evasive, even when presented with direct questions. For instance, she says three weeks ago she asked Enron management if the company was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. They said ""no,"" she says. In light of the company's acknowledgment this week of an SEC ""inquiry,"" she asked Enron about the previous denial. ""They told me it is an inquiry, not an investigation,"" she says. An Enron spokeswoman says the company learned of the SEC's inquiry only last Wednesday.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The energy trading company, whose shares have fallen 52percent since Oct. 16, will use part of the money to redeem about$1.85 billion short-term commercial debt, the Wall Street Journalreported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter.     Enron is talking to banks about a new, multi-billion line ofcredit, the paper reported, citing the unidentified person. Thesteps are seen as an effort by the energy trader to ensure that ithas adequate liquidity in case its access to bank credit isdisrupted, the paper said.     Enron said in a statement distributed by PR Newswire that itdrew on its credit lines to provide more than $1 billion in cashliquidity. The steps come a day after Chief Financial OfficerAndrew Fastow resigned amid a Securities and Exchange Commissionprobe of partnerships he ran.--William Selway in the San Francisco newsroom at (415) 743-3511,Oct. 25, 2001, 11:22PMHouston ChronicleAction by Enron halts stock's fall But credit ratings are being reviewed By LAURA GOLDBERG Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle The recent freefall of Enron Corp.'s stock price stabilized Thursday, a day after the world's largest energy trader replaced its chief financial officer. Enron, under a cloud for a number of reasons, including an Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry, also made two announcements Thursday night aimed at reassuring the financial community. In the announcements, Enron said it had drawn more than $1 billion from its lines of credit and said that energy-trading business done through EnronOnline on Thursday was above average levels. Houston-based Enron banked the money and has no plans to spend it, a spokeswoman said. ""We are making it clear that Enron has the full support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments in the ordinary course of business,"" Jeff McMahon, who took over Wednesday as chief financial officer, said in a written statement. Enron said it recorded more than 8,300 transactions through EnronOnline on Thursday. Ken Lay, chairman and chief executive officer, said: ""Enron continues to be the market-maker of choice in wholesale and gas power markets, our customers continue to put their confidence in us, and our core businesses are strong and performing well."" Earlier Thursday, two credit rating agencies took actions regarding Enron's ratings, which J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Anatol Feygin described as ""just more negative sentiment."" At one point in Thursday morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares in Enron were up more than $1.50, but they closed down 6 cents at $16.35. As recently as Oct. 16, the stock closed at $33.84. Before the market closed, international credit-rating agency Fitch put Enron, which currently holds investment-grade credit ratings, on review for a possible downgrade. Then after the market closed, Standard & Poor's took two steps: It affirmed Enron's current ratings, but it also revised its long-term ratings outlook to negative. Moody's Investors Service put all of Enron's long-term debt on review for potential downgrade last week. Enron, which noted that losing its investment-grade rating would take downgrades of three notches, said Thursday it will do everything in its power to defend its current rating. In the SEC inquiry, federal securities regulators are reviewing transactions between Enron and two private investment partnerships formerly run by Andrew Fastow, who was removed as Enron's chief financial officer Wednesday. Enron removed Fastow as part of its bid to repair its damaged credibility. Wall Street is also questioning certain of Enron's financing vehicles and is wondering whether the company will face hits to its balance sheet in the months ahead. S&P said it was concerned that the sizable drop in Enron's market capitalization has negatively affected its financial flexibility and could hurt the company's plans to rebuild its balance sheet. But it also noted that the ""fundamental strength"" of Enron's energy marketing and trading business has remained steady. Unless Enron's rebuilds confidence among investors and business partners, Fitch said, it could ""impair Enron's financial flexibility and access to capital markets,"" which would hurt its ability to conduct business. Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston, said the actions by S&P and Fitch might make some of Enron's energy customers skittish. Corporate US on track for bailoutDAVID GOW IN NEW YORK10/26/2001The GuardianCopyright (C) 2001 The Guardian; Source: World Reporter (TM)Battered corporate America will receive an immediate Dollars 25bn (pounds 18bn) tax rebate under a Dollars 100bn eocnomic stimulation package just approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. The controversial package, worth an estimated Dollars 212bn over three years, includes Dollars 70bn for companies next year alone. It was approved by the House late on Wednesday by 216 votes to 214, but faces significant amendment in the Senate, which is now under Democrat control.It has reopened a wide ideological rift between Republicans, who favour corporate and individual tax cuts to reboot an economy mired in recession, and Democrats - who, in a reprise of the Roosevelt ""new deal"", prefer to see increased public spending on unemployment and infrastructure projects. Liberal lobby groups such as the Citizens for Tax Justice and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities claim the bill would hand back Dollars 6.3bn to the 14 biggest corporations - which, they say, are renowned for paying little or no tax. The most hotly contested measure is the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, or AMT, introduced in 1986 to make sure firms could not avoid all tax payments. This, strongly supported by President Bush, would be made retroactive so that all AMT payments would be refunded. The lobby groups and the non-partisan Congressional Research Service calculate that this would give a Dollars 1.4bn boost to computer group IBM alone, while General Motors would get back Dollars 833m and General Electric Dollars 671m. Others to benefit include TXU, the Texas-based utility that is the US's third largest energy supplier, which would would be given Dollars 608m. United Airlines, the US's second largest carrier - which is warning of bankruptcy - would receive Dollars 371m, and Enron, the energy trading group forced to sack its finance director this week, would be given Dollars 254m. Democrat leaders in the Senate are determined to erase this measure and dislike other proposals to boost firms, which include a 30% tax break for capital investment over three years worth Dollars 39.3bn this year alone. They say these amount to a ""giant corporate giveaway"". Mr Bush and other Republican leaders argue these fiscal concessions would help companies making hundreds of thousands redundant avoid further lay-offs and invest more, prompting an economic recovery that, at best, is likely to start in the new year. ""Businesses are America's employers. They're the hardware store, the diner down the street, the gas station on the corner. They're not the enemy of working families,"" the author of the plan, Representative Bill Thomas of California, said. Democrats are especially incensed with the alleged paucity of the package's provisions for the growing numbers of jobless, arguing that much of the Dollars 12bn foreseen would not go to individuals but into the reserves of states. * A fresh round of global trade talks is essential to revitalise the world economy after the terrorist attacks on the US, trade secretary Patricia Hewitt said yesterday, writes Charlotte Denny As a new report predicted that global trade growth will collapse this year, Ms Hewitt warned that the world must not retreat into protectionism or isolationism in the wake of the attacks. WTO trade ministers are gathering in Doha, Qatar, in two weeks' time to discuss launching a new round of talks, the first since the collapse of their meeting in Seattle, nearly two years ago.

Business/Financial Desk; Section CHarvey Pitt's S.E.C.: From Guard Dog to Friendly Puppy?By FLOYD NORRIS10/26/2001The New York TimesPage 1, Column 2c. 2001 New York Times CompanyCAN the new, friendlier Securities and Exchange Commission enforce the laws and assure investors that corporate financial reports are trustworthy? Harvey L. Pitt, the new S.E.C. chairman, set out this week to show that he is not like his predecessor, Arthur Levitt. In a speech to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants -- an organization whose senior leadership led a bitter and ultimately unsuccessful fight against Mr. Levitt's reform efforts -- Mr. Pitt praised his listeners and took a few swipes at his predecessor. From now on, he promised, ''the commission will make sound decisions, in a respectful, affirmative way, not in a demeaning, demanding or demonizing way.'' He spoke favorably of ''pro forma'' earnings reports, in ways that no doubt heartened accountants who have worked so hard to find ways to make even the worst profit figures look pretty. There was no mention of Mr. Levitt's concerns about improper management of earnings.On the heels of Mr. Pitt's speech, the S.E.C. used a minor enforcement action to herald a policy of not cracking down on companies that come forward to report their own errors. The decision itself was reasonable, although one could wonder if top management did something wrong in failing to detect a fraud that went on for years. But the way the S.E.C. trumpeted it raised questions about whether the agency is turning into a friendly puppy rather than a guard dog. ''Is this amnesty for financial fraud?'' Jane Adams, the accounting analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston and a former S.E.C. staff member, asked in a report to clients. She was not sure of the answer. In an interview yesterday, Mr. Pitt dismissed such worries. ''No one is going to get away with anything,'' he said. ''What we are trying to do is create an environment where people feel comfortable'' and can talk to the S.E.C. ''without feeling we are looking for a big splash.'' A major embarrassment for accountants is having the S.E.C. force a client to restate its numbers. Mr. Pitt and his chief accountant, Robert Herdman, are sending signals that fewer such demands will be made. ''I am very much in favor of a vigorous enforcement program,'' Mr. Pitt said in the interview, ''but I am not in favor of having investors barraged by conflicting statements and restatements.'' Mr. Pitt talks of companies ''getting it right the first time,'' which would certainly be nice. But there is a risk that companies will become more aggressive in their accounting, figuring there will be no real penalty, like a restatement, if they are caught. That would make life harder for auditors who try to resist misleading accounting. In trying to sound comforting to the accountants' group -- an organization that, as he noted, he had represented as a lawyer for two decades -- Mr. Pitt has done little to reassure investors of his independence. The proof, of course, will come in the performance. Fortunately, the mess at Enron gives the S.E.C. a golden opportunity to counter the puppy image. It will take time for the commission to determine if the company's accounting was proper. But there need be no delay in forcing Enron to clearly explain -- rather than obfuscate as it has so far -- the strange deals it made with partnerships run by the executive just ousted as chief financial officer. ''This could,'' a former S.E.C. staff member said, ''focus the issue on whether companies can make completely correct but totally misleading disclosures.'' And it would indicate that this watchdog still has a bite.Photo: Harvey L. Pitt Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Swanson mailto:kcswanson@thestreet.comStaff Reporter10/26/2001 07:08 AM EDTURL: http://www.thestreet.com/markets/dumbest/10003035.htmlTheStreet.com1. United Airlines Just a Little Too HonestRule No. 1 in CEO school: Never say that your company may soon collapse. Seems kind of obvious, but that rule was flouted by United Airlines chief James Goodwin, who warned in a letter to employees that the company ""will perish"" next year unless it can stanch its tremendous losses, which have worsened since the terrorist attacks. ""Today, we are literally hemorrhaging money,"" he wrote. In raising concerns about the financial viability of United, a unit of UAL (UAL:NYSE - news - commentary) , Goodwin only put into words what outsiders have speculated about. Since Sept. 11, the airline has laid off about 20,000 of its 100,000 employees and cut flights by as much as 25%. It's expected to announce massive losses when it reports third-quarter earnings. But in response to the disclosure, Goodwin has been roundly attacked. Feeling that he had been all too honest, investors have knocked an additional 24% off the stock's value. The shares are down 54% since Sept 11. Meanwhile, UAL union leaders reportedly say Goodwin has exaggerated company difficulties to gain bargaining leverage in union negotiations. The leaders of one union have petitioned the company's board of directors to have him sacked. Bottom line: CEOs may get pilloried when they try to dodge the truth, but sometimes it doesn't pay to be too candid about worst-case scenarios, either. Especially when that scenario is the company's own demise. 2. Forget the Victory Gardens; Let's Have a Comfortable War Sure, we're at war with a band of cave-dwelling outlaws hell bent on our annihilation. But would all freedom-loving Americans please go out and buy some DVD players? Maybe even a nice new car? That was basically the message from the Treasury Department, on news that Congress had voted for the creation of war bonds to finance antiterrorism efforts and rebuilding following the attacks. Officials at Treasury applauded the sentiment, then politely suggested it would be even better for the economy if Americans just went to stores and bought stuff. ""The economy is perhaps our greatest asset as we move forward in these efforts to fight the war on global terrorists,"" says Betsy Holahan, a department spokesperson. ""War bonds are an additional way for Americans to show their patriotism."" For the record, we don't think an issue of war bonds would be dumb, just superfluous. After all, nothing's stopped Americans from buying generic savings bonds -- or better yet, Treasuries -- all of which finance spending by the federal government. In the meantime, it's a little dislocating to hear politicians talk up war bonds -- which most people associate with hardship and sacrifice -- at the same time top economic gurus are practically begging people to shop. War bonds notwithstanding, we're a long way off from the era of ration books. 3. Enron AgainLast week, we noted the extent of alarm about Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) revelation that its shareholder equity had dropped $1.2 billion, following some unusual and possibly inappropriate high-level transactions. Following that disclosure, besieged CFO Andrew Fastow has finally left the company on what's delicately termed a ""leave of absence."" In July, Fastow exited a limited partnership, from which he had reportedly reaped large profits, after shareholders and analysts objected to his involvement. Concerns about those dealings and others had increased in the wake of the disclosure about the charge to equity until even management acknowledged Fastow would have to go as a prerequisite to restoring investor confidence. But that won't be an easy task, given the resentment about Enron's disinclination to explain its problems. One analyst called Fastow's departure ""unsettling,"" noting that management had given the CFO its endorsement only the day before. Sounding a note of exasperation, analysts at J.P. Morgan Chase, Banc of America Securities and Prudential all downgraded the stock. And there could be more trouble to come: The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued Enron a letter of inquiry related to some of its transactions. 4. Gold Diggers It's understandable that investors felt panicky in September. Unfortunately, some reacted by shoving their hard-earned money into gold funds. According to Financial Research Corp., which tracks fund flows, the specialty precious-metals category was the best-selling equity category during September, with net inflows of $101 million. Granted, that's not a huge sum in the mutual fund world. By comparison, during the same month, large growth funds saw net redemptions of $7.4 billion. But the fact that so many people are jumping into precious metals is noteworthy, given that gold funds have performed so badly for so long. Sure, under the bizarre circumstances of late, they've enjoyed somewhat of a pop. According to Morningstar, the average precious-metals fund is up 10.08% year to date. But over the past five years, the same category lost an embarrassing 14.68%. By comparison, even large-cap growth funds -- everybody's favorite whipping boy -- managed to post a positive return. In the same period, they were up 7.13%. Moreover, circumstances that would seem to be the most favorable in decades -- a combination of attacks on the U.S. government and war -- still don't seem to have boosted gold prices significantly. Despite an initial surge in prices after the terrorist attacks, they're again approaching their pre-Sept. 11 levels. It's too early to say, but it's likely the gold bugs will confront disappointment once again. 5. Amazon Amazes Once AgainAmazon (AMZN:Nasdaq - news - commentary) still maintains it will become profitable by the fourth quarter. Well, at least it will post a pro forma operating profit. OK, so maybe that wouldn't include Amazon's service on $2.17 billion in long-term debt or extraordinary charges. In fact, a pro forma operating profit is basically just an accounting concept that would lend a fuzzy, meaningless aura of minor triumph. The company still hasn't said when it will turn an economic profit. For that matter, even the fourth-quarter prediction is iffy. After announcing the company expected to turn the pro forma operating profit, CFO Warren Jenson added the humble qualifier, ""There are no guarantees."" Amazon simultaneously lowered its forecast for fourth-quarter revenue, predicting that sales would be somewhere between flat and up by 10% compared with a year ago. Third-quarter trends weren't encouraging. Though sales overall were up slightly in the third quarter from a year ago, revenue from the company's core books and music business actually fell 12%. At least the company has made progress in cutting costs: A spokesperson says pro forma operating expenses have decreased by 20% over the past year. Incidentally, in the wake of Amazon's earnings report, two analysts made the belated decision to cut their ratings on the stock, which has fallen 93% from its high back in December 1999. Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodget and SG Cowen analyst Scott Reamer downgraded the stock to ""neutral"" from previous buy ratings. ""We thought there might be upside to our estimates,"" noted Blodget. ""There wasn't."" FinancialStocks Post Gains After A Rough MorningAssociated Press10/26/2001The Washington PostFINALE03Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights ReservedNEW YORK, Oct. 25 -- Selected buying of technology and energy shares pulled the stock market higher today, reversing a morning slide triggered by a pair of grim economic reports. Shares of semiconductor makers and equipment manufacturers did particularly well, as did energy traders, led by a surprisingly strong performance from Williams Cos., a Tulsa-based energy firm that had an 83 percent jump in third-quarter net earnings.The Dow Jones industrial average closed rose at 9448.78, up 103.16, reversing an earlier deficit of 167 points. The Nasdaq composite index rose 36.29, to 1767.83, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index was rose 12.79, to 1097.99. Earlier, a pair of dismal economic reports had compounded worries about the fallout from last month's terrorist attacks to send stocks lower. As in recent sessions, however, investors absorbed the bad news and focused on good news regarding individual companies. Williams Cos. surpassed analysts' estimates for the third quarter and raised its forecasts for full-year earnings for 2001 and 2002. Investors rewarded the company by driving its shares up $1.42, to $27.32, bringing several other parts of the energy sector along with it. Even the shares of Enron rose, a day after the embattled company dismissed its chief financial officer and replaced him with an another executive from within the company. Enron rose 28 cents, to $16.69. Semiconductor shares also rebounded, led by industry bellwether Intel, up 44 cents at $25.92, and Applied Materials, up $1.35 at 36.69. Leading data-storage maker EMC rose $1.06, to $13.54. Traders said the Senate's passage this afternoon of an anti-terrorism measure also helped lift investor sentiment. Late Wednesday, the House passed a $100 billion economic stimulus package to combat the effects of the terrorist attacks on the economy. A surprisingly large drop in orders for durable goods had weighed heavily on the market in the morning, as did poor earnings results from American International Group and WorldCom.

Enron Taps $3 Billion From Bank Lines in Pre-Emptive Move to Ensure Liquidity10/25/2001Dow Jones Business News(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)Embattled Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available bank credit lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liquidity, Friday's Wall Street Journal reported. Enron (ENE) will use part of the money to offer to redeem around $1.85 billion in outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- according to a person familiar with the matter, with the remainder used to provide a cash cushion. This person also said that Enron was talking to its banks about a new multibillion-dollar credit line. Some observers thought the moves were a pre-emptive step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted.Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong. But ""when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last few days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank,"" said an Enron spokesman. In a prepared statement, the company's new chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, ""we are making it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments."" The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the Houston energy-trading firm in the past 10 days. Enron is the nation's largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all electricity and natural-gas trades. Thursday, for example, Enron was involved in about $4 billion worth of deals through its EnronOnline unit. Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. It has reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it did with entities run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was replaced Wednesday. The draw-down of the credit facilities came as a major rating agency, Fitch, put Enron on review for a possible downgrade while Standard & Poors changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investors Service has already said it is looking at a possible downgrade. In order to fall below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have to fall several notches. If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. Together with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment grade rating would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue millions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of existing shares. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were down six cents at $16.35. Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.DALLAS (AP) - Kenneth Lay, the chairman and chief executive of embattled Enron Corp., has resigned from the board of software company i2 Technologies. ""This is a very painful decision,"" Lay said in a statement issued Thursday by Dallas-based i2 Technologies. ""But now that I am again taking on the CEO responsibilities at Enron, I must reduce my outside activities.""Lay resumed the chief executive's job at Enron in August after Jeff Skilling surprised investors by leaving the Houston-based energy company. Enron officials did not immediately return calls from The Associated Press. In the past week, Enron has been rocked by questions surrounding partnerships that did business with Enron while they were managed by the company's chief financial officer. The official was replaced on Tuesday. Enron's stock price has fallen nearly 50 percent since interest in the partnerships intensified, and the company acknowledged that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the arrangements I2 makes software to help companies manage their supply chains, and its clients include Texas Instruments, Ford Motor Co. and Dell Computer Corp. I2 stock plunged nearly 25 percent on Oct. 17 after the company reported a $5.53 billion third-quarter loss and said it would cut 1,000 jobs, about one-fifth of the work force.

As Enron's woes unnerve investors about energy sector, analysts say its problems are isolatedBy BRAD FOSSAP Business Writer10/25/2001Associated Press NewswiresCopyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.NEW YORK (AP) - As it grew over the past decade into the country's largest natural gas and power marketing company, Enron Corp. became the de facto barometer of health within the energy trading sector. Wall Street buoyed the stock prices of Enron's competitors based in part on the huge success of the Houston-based company's business model. Now, executives and industry analysts hope to prevent Enron's internal tumult and free-falling stock price from undermining investors' confidence in the sector. They say the Houston-based company's problems should be viewed in isolation and not as a broader indicator of the marketplace.""The marketplace for natural gas and power trading is as vibrant as it was yesterday, a week ago or a month ago,"" said Jim Donnell, president of Duke Energy North America, a division of Duke Energy Corp. that generates and trades power. That opinion appeared to gain acceptance on Thursday as shares of Dynegy Inc., El Paso Corp. and Duke Energy Corp. rebounded from losses on Wednesday, when Enron's latest woes appeared to spill over into the stock prices of its rivals. Enron's stock has fallen about 50 percent in the past week (and nearly 80 percent since January) and analysts said its recovery is not expected anytime soon. The latest troubles began Oct. 16 when Enron reported third quarter earnings, and a longtime concern among Wall Street analysts that executives were not entirely forthcoming only got worse. First came reports that some of the company's losses stemmed from partnerships managed by Enron's chief financial officer at the time, Andrew Fastow. That raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest and touched off an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Then on Wednesday, one day after Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay defended Fastow, the company ousted him and said he would take a leave of absence. ""They created an environment in which their credibility was put to the test and they didn't come through with flying colors,"" said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst at Williams Capital Group in New York. Enron shares have been falling all year for reasons new and old, which have little to do with the company's wholesale energy business, which accounts for roughly 80 percent of profits. Analysts insist wholesale energy marketing can be profitable even in the face of an economic downturn and falling natural gas and electricity prices. ""Even though (Enron) shot themselves in the foot, the basic business is still sound and not likely to disappear,"" Ellinghaus said. UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone echoed that sentiment. ""The collateral damage to the rest of the space - Dynegy and El Paso - is overdone,"" Barone said. On Thursday, Williams Companies Inc. of Tulsa, Okla., reported net income of $760 million and Reliant Resources Inc. of Houston reported $133 million in profits. ""It's business as usual,"" said Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel. Not for Enron, whose stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when its nascent high-speed Internet unit failed to live up to the hype. The downward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from power customers in India and the surprise departure in August of then-chief executive Jeff Skilling was considered another bad sign. On Oct. 16, Enron reported a net loss of $638 million in the third quarter, taking a one-time charge of $1.01 billion attributed to investment losses, troubled assets and unit restructurings. Excluding the charge, Enron earned $393 million on $47.6 billion in revenues for the three months ending Sept. 30. Ellinghaus said the stocks of Enron's competitors were brought down Wednesday because of ""dire"" speculation that Enron's troubles might be so bad that it could have difficulty paying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of receivables to companies such as Duke and Dynegy. ""All I'm hearing is doomsday type stuff and doomsday is not reality,"" Ellinghaus said. Enron did not return calls seeking comment Thursday. Donnell of Duke Energy said the Charlotte, N.C.-based company is paying close attention to the Enron situation and that there has been no indication of receivables not being paid. ""They continue to be one of the best functioning companies as it relates to credit,"" he said. ""They've never missed a deadline.""AP Graphic ENERGY STOCKS Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron's Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by S&P (Update1)2001-10-25 18:59 (New York)Enron's Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by S&P (Update1)     (Adds analyst comment in fourth paragraph.)     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s long-termcredit ratings outlook was changed to negative from stable byStandard & Poor's after the largest energy trader's shares fell49 percent in the past week.     S&P affirmed the Houston-based company's ratings of``BBB+/A2,'' which are investment grade.     The ratings company cited lost market capitalization and thepossibility that Enron won't generate enough money from sellingassets outside the main trading business to repay debt. S&P didsay that ``the strategic direction of the company is likely tobecome more credit-positive in the wake of recent managementchanges.''     Enron reported $1.01 billion in losses from investmentsoutside the principal business of trading commodities such aselectricity and natural gas. Chief Financial Officer AndrewFastow resigned yesterday as the U.S. Securities and ExchangeCommission asks for information about related-party transactionshe conducted.     ``The S&P write up was very positive,'' said DorotheaMatthews, an analyst at CreditSights Inc., a research firm. ``Itseems that the ratings company went out of its way to tray andcalm things down.''

Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Concerns Enron Corp. will runshort on cash haven't prevented commodities traders from doingbusiness with the largest energy broker, customers say.     The company handles about 25 percent of U.S. power andnatural-gas trading, said John Kilduff, vice president of energyrisk management for Fimat USA. It's also a leader in complexderivatives that allow others to hedge against the risk offluctuating commodities prices.     Enron's credit rating is on watch for possible downgrade atMoody's Investors Service, and Standard & Poor's lowered Enron'slong-term credit outlook to negative after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from some soured investments. The company needsgood credit to raise cash every day to keep trading partners fromdemanding collateral and to settle transactions.     So far, there are no signs that Houston-based Enron ishandling less business, Kilduff said.     ``If they were unable to perform, it would be a majorproblem,'' he said. ``It could get like Long-Term Capital ifthings really broke down because the numbers are that big.''     Long-Term Capital Management, a private investment fund forthe wealthy, incurred massive losses making bond trades during the1998 Russian currency crisis. The fund's portfolio plunged. Morethan a dozen banks bailed out the fund at a cost of $3.6 billionto avoid a collapse.                         Needs Cash Daily     Enron trades electricity, natural gas, coal and othercommodities worldwide, as well as complex financial instruments tohedge against price swings in the goods.     ``As of now, Enron is active in the markets,'' Kilduff said.``No one is cutting trading lines that I can see, or demandingdifferent terms than before.''     Companies that trade as heavily as Enron require cash everyday to settle positions, said Kilduff, whose company swaps naturalgas and other energy investments with Enron.     Some days, Fimat will bet that natural-gas prices will fall,while Enron bets that they will rise. Natural gas usually does oneor the other every day, and someone pays the difference.     ``The liquidity of your trading partners is a risk factor,''Kilduff said. ``Someone is paying someone else every day.''     Enron said on a conference call Tuesday that it has enoughmoney to operate normally, and can fall back on $3.4 billion inbank credit lines if necessary. The company is determined toprotect the credit rating, Enron has said.     ``We aren't even going to entertain worst-case scenarios atthis point,'' said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne.                        Investor Questions     Enron, based in Houston, ousted Chief Financial OfficerAndrew Fastow yesterday, two days after the U.S. Securities andExchange Commission began asking questions about partnerships heran that invested in company shares. Those trades cost Enron $35million. Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets unit,replaced Fastow, who went on leave of absence.     Enron shares have fallen 49 percent in the past week. Theyfell 6 cents to $16.35 today.     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels aboveinvestment grade. Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's all ratethe company's debt at investment grade.     The company also faces questions from investors about $3.3billion in potential liabilities from affiliated companies formedto buy and sell Enron assets such as power plants.     The affiliates owe payments to bond investors and plan tomeet them by selling assets. Enron doesn't know if the saleproceeds will cover the debt. The company would have to make goodon any shortfall.                            Little Time     Enron asked Citicorp Inc. on Tuesday to arrange a $750million loan to ensure access to credit if the company gets shutout of the money markets.     Enron had about $1.85 billion of commercial paper, or short-term unsecured debt, outstanding as of Tuesday, traders said. Thecompany, which has a $3 billion program, has had difficultyfinding buyers for new commercial paper sales since the SECinvestigation was announced, the traders said.     Today, Enron offered two-week commercial paper at a 3 percentyield, 10 to 15 basis points above comparably rated companies.     ``There appears to be enough liquidity to give them enoughtime to get their house in order,'' said Jon Kyle Cartwright,senior energy credit analyst at Raymond James & Associates.``There's a point where a credibility crisis becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, so they have less time than they think topacify the market.''                           Ripple Effect     Some investors are concerned that Enron's complex book ofhedges, swaps, options and other derivative contracts involves somany partners, participants and companies that a failure wouldpose a risk to the economy, and force a bailout like Long-TermCapital Management's.     ``The talk in the financial markets is that some counterparty to Enron could fail if Enron can't perform,'' said JeffCaughron, manager of $400 million in investments for TinkerFederal Credit Union in Oklahoma City. ``If it goes down, therecould be a big ripple effect.''     The effect has already spread as investors worry Enron won'tbe able to pay bills owed to power producers such as CalpineCorp., Dynegy Inc., Mirant Corp. and NRG Inc., said ChrisEllinghaus, an analyst at Williams Capital Group. As a group,shares of the four have fallen 11 percent in the past week.     ``Rumors that these companies have receivables with Enron arefueling a sell-off,'' he said. ``Both traders and companiesselling power to Enron are suffering.''     All four companies said they're trading with Enron as theyhave in the past.                         Market Maker     Enron supplies services some customers considerirreplaceable. The Sacramento Municipal Utilities District hedgesweather risk through Enron, said risk manager Jim Tracy.     The district entered into an agreement that forces it to payEnron if rainfall is abundant and hydroelectric dams can operateat peak efficiency and capacity; in dry seasons, when the damscan't operate as well, Enron pays the district.     ``If Enron's credit went bad, or they folded up, thatagreement wouldn't get picked up by someone else,'' Tracy said.     Enron also helps many U.S. utilities protect themselves fromelectricity and natural gas price fluctuations in the same way ithelps the Sacramento utility district hedge against too littlerainfall. Any impairment on Enron's part to continue doing sowould trickle down to Main Street utilities, Tracy said.     ``Utilities would start reserving more on their balancesheets for price swings,'' Tracy said.--Russell Hubbard in the Princeton newsroom at 609-750-4651, or atEnron Broadband Begins Closing London, Singapore OfficesBy Erwin SebaOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES10/25/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) telecommunications unit will close down its trading offices in London and Singapore over the next six months. Enron Broadband Services executives have quietly begun to inform employees overseas and haven't made a public announcement of plans to consolidate Asian and European bandwidth trading operations at the company's Houston headquarters.""It's a way to structure the business to fit the opportunities that are out there in the market now,"" Enron Broadband Services spokeswoman Terrie James said in response to questions from Dow Jones Newswires. The London office has 20 or fewer employees, James told Dow Jones. The Singapore office has 15 or fewer employees. Americans working in the offices would probably choose to relocate in the U.S., James said. She didn't know how many of the employees are U.S. citizens. She didn't know what options might be offered to the non-American employees. James didn't know how much money Enron might save by closing the offices. The decision by Enron, the leading bandwidth market-maker, shows that international bandwidth markets are having tough times like the U.S. market. Earlier this year, as the U.S. market went sour, Enron executives had said that European and Asian telecommunications carriers might be more open to bandwidth trading, making the markets in those regions ripe for growth. -By Erwin Seba, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9214; erwin.seba@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(CPN) has no credit exposure to trading partner Enron Corp. (ENE), Calpine said Thursday in an earnings conference call. And the company hasn't been contacted by the state of California about renegotiating the billions of dollars in long-term supply contracts the company signed with the state earlier this year. Calpine's diluted net earnings for the third quarter were 88 cents a share compared with 48 cents for the same quarter last year. Setting Calpine's consistent earnings growth aside, Wall Street analysts in Thursday's conference call focused their questions on trouble spots in the energy industry, like Enron, California, and whether the U.S. will have a surplus of electric power stations in a few years.Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this week. Trading partners like Calpine have been asked about their exposure to Enron. ""We continue to assess the situation, but right now don't have any net exposure to Enron,"" said Calpine's vice president of corporate risk management, Paul Pasoli. ""We continue to trade with them. We will adjust our credit threshold based on how their bonds are trading and their credit rating."" When asked if there would be any exposure to Enron if trading were to be halted immediately, Pasoli said that, in fact, Calpine would owe Enron a little money. In another energy industry area of concern, Calpine was asked about the state of California's stated desire to renegotiate tens of billions of dollars of long-term power contracts. Calpine is by far the biggest supplier under those contracts, which on a mark-to-market basis are worth far less now than when California bought this past winter and spring. ""Nobody has come to us directly or indirectly with regard to the Calif contracts. In general, we respect our contracts and expect our counterparties to do so as well,"" said Calpine cheif executive, Peter Cartwright. ""If there are any contract renegotiations that can result in a win-win, we would be happy to look at that, if California asks. We've done that many times."" As for future power prices, Calpine said that it's going forward with its program to build a portfolio of 70,000 megawatts of generation, which is about three times its current capacity and would be about 7% of all U.S. capacity. The critical determinant of profitability in power generation is the difference between natural gas prices and power prices, and Calpine said that difference, or ""spark spread,"" has grown the past few months. Furthermore, the company executives said they are holding to a requirement that all projects generate an after-tax return of 18% on the investment. As a result, the company expects earnings to grow at least 40% annually through 2005. Calpine will fund near-term cash needs in the debt markets and won't issue new stock until its stock price rises substantially. -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Lay, Jeffrey K. Skilling, and Andrew Fastow, on behalf of purchasers of the common stock of Enron during the period between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the ""Class Period""). The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, thereby artificially inflating the price of Enron common stock. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Enron issued a series of statements concerning its business, financial results and operations which failed to disclose (i) that the Company's Broadband Services Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the Company's efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy; (ii) that the Company's operating results were materially overstated as result of the Company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships which were managed by the Company's chief financial officer; and (iii) that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. On October 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market by announcing that the Company was taking non-recurring charges of $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2001, the period ending September 30, 2001. Subsequently, Enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled by Enron's chief financial officer and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. During the Class Period, Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally held Enron common stock to unsuspecting investors.If you purchased Enron securities during the Class Period, you may, no later than December 21, 2001, move to be appointed as a Lead Plaintiff in this class action.

(ENE) drew on committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity of more than $1 billion. In a press release Thursday, the energy company said it has ""more than adequate"" liquidity to fulfill business commitments.Enron said the credit action is a step to restore investor confidence, and it plans to update investors in several days regarding plans to maintain its long-term credit rating. Earlier Thursday, Standard & Poor's revised its long-term ratings outlook for Enron to negative due to concerns that the company's significant drop in market capitalization has hurt the company's flexibility and could impair plans to rebuild the balance sheet. Over the past week, Enron's shares have fallen more than 40% amid negative news from the company. The company's New York Stock Exchange-listed shares closed Thursday at $16.35, down 6 cents, or 0.4%, on composite volume of 39,212,300 shares. Average daily volume is 7,832,606 shares. Early last week, the company reported a $618 million third quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. Enron also disclosed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. On Wednesday, Enron replaced Fastow with Jeff McMahon, effective immediately. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that some bond traders believe Enron's bonds won't continue to hold up better the company's stock. The company's five-year bond has decreased about 16% in the past two weeks, much less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct. 16 disclosure of the $1.01 billion charges. But the fall in the bond's price translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage points above bellwether U.S. government bonds, which is widening from about 3 percentage points two weeks ago. Although Enron is still an investment-grade credit, that kind of ""spread"" is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of single B or lower, the Journal said. On Wednesday, Fitch put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possible downgrade, following a similar move by Moody's Investor Service earlier this week. Several energy trading companies said Thursday that although they have concerns about Enron's credit quality, they have made almost no changes in policy concerning the company. Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Williams Cos. (WMB) and Aquila Inc. (ILA) said they haven't changed their credit policy concerning Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in U.S. power and gas markets. The Journal reported that bond traders expect Enron executives to meet with rating agencies, debt-trading desks, big bond holders and banks next week.

Enron Employees Watch Options Devalue as Shares Fall (Correct)2001-10-25 18:41 (New York)Enron Employees Watch Options Devalue as Shares Fall (Correct)     (Company corrects structure of standard compensation packagein second paragraph.)     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. prided itself onsharing the wealth with employees when the company was postingrecord profits last year. Now, from the boardroom to the mailroom,employees are sharing the pain.     Enron, the largest energy trader, grants stock options to thebulk of its 20,000 employees. Under Enron's standard compensationpackage, most employees get stock options equal to5 percent of their annual base salary, spokeswoman MeredithPhilipp said.     Employees held 46.8 million exercisable options as of the endof 2000, all at average prices above the company's current shareprice. The stock has dropped 80 percent this year.     ``Virtually every option is under water right now,'' Enronspokeswoman Karen Denne said.     Enron's board sets the strike price for the options inDecember or January. Employees can't cash the options in and makea profit unless the stock is trading above the strike price. Atthe end of 2000, Enron shares were trading at $83.13. In December,the board set a strike price of about $80.     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.They have lost 37 percent of their value so far this week.     Enron said Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commissionwas asking questions about partnerships run by Andrew Fastow, whowas ousted as Enron's chief financial officer yesterday. Onepartnership cost the company $35 million, and Enron bought back 62million shares from a partnership at a cost of $1.2 billion.     Enron named Jeff McMahon, head of its industrial marketsgroup, as CFO late yesterday.                         Unvested Options     Another 96.1 million options granted to Enron employeeshadn't vested as of the end of last year. About 15.4 million ofthem, or 16 percent, were at prices ranging from $6.88 to $20 ashare. The rest vest at levels well above the current share price.     Experts who have watched the devaluation of stock options inother industries, such as technology and telecommunications, sayit becomes demoralizing for workers to watch share prices fallbelow their options.     ``It looks bad,'' said Mark Edwards, chairman of IQuanticBuck, a Mellon Financial Corp. unit that provides compensationconsulting. ``Employees look at (the stock price) every day, andit's a continued disincentive to them.''     While Denne said Enron doesn't have any plans to reprice itsemployees' options, the company did issue a one-time stock optiongrant at $36.88 in August, when Ken Lay resumed his former role asthe company's chief executive. Lay, who had held the job for 15years, turned the position over to Jeffrey Skilling in February.Skilling quit in August, citing family reasons.     The August grant, which was equivalent to 5 percent ofemployees' base salary, didn't require a vesting period, but wasexercisable immediately. Enron's shares haven't closed above$36.88 since Aug. 29.--Margot Habiby in the Dallas newsroom (214) 954-9452, or",0

"We seem to be going round in circle's here and hence hopefully all the relevant people are now on copy of this e-mail so we can resolve swiftly.

"Louise:I just wanted to send you a quick note with the hope that you might have a chance to read your e-mail. It seemed more awkward to me to try and catch you in person giving the frenetic pace and fluidity of our situation.Basically all I want to tell you is that I'm here to help in this process, and encourage you to let me know if there is anything else in particular I can help on. I have spoken and offered the same directly to Miller, Calger and Duran. I'm not telling folks this out of lack of current work flow. As I think you know, the development group is in the middle of several active transactions that we expect to close in the near term, and we remain keenly focused on making these deals happen (as evidenced by the $1.375 million Doyle insurance settlement finalized today). I'm approaching you and others specifically because I have 2 years of Chapter 11 bankruptcy experience. Prior to me joining Enron in May of 1998, I was with Kenetech Corporation (a 1,200 employee publicly traded IPP). In 1996 (after having worked as an Originator at Kenetech since 1990), Kenetech filed for Chapter 11. As part of the Chapter 11 process, I was one of 6 senior commercial employees retained by the Company to be responsible for liquidating the Company's assets. As such, I am very familiar with the Chapter 11 process, and how deals get done in this context. Enron is obviously of a far greater magnitude, but I believe the basic skills and experience are directly applicable.Again, as we go through this process, I just wanted to make you aware of my experience in this area, and let you know that I stand ready, willing and eager to take on additional tasks.With respect to our current deal flow, I also wanted to let you know we are working on the following which I will get to you by Friday (or earlier if need be):1. Transaction list, status, and valuation;2. Site bank summary and exit / monetization strategy;3. Projected site bank maintenance budget.I will, of course, also provide this information to Miller, Calger and Duran.Best regards,Ben",0

LCs Expiring 12/31/2001Debbie/Bill - Enron Direct Canada Corp. (EES Canada) has 7 LCs expiring 12/31/01.  In order to continue serving current retail customers under existing contracts and adding new retail customers in Alberta, the security requirements will need to be met.  Enron Direct Canada Corp. has estimated what their requirements will be as of the time the LCs expire, and is outlined in the email below.  The total security requirement comes to approximately $6 million USD.  The bank we now have the LCs with, The Toronto-Dominion Bank, has notified Enron Corp. Treasury that they will not renew the LCs.  Enron Corp. does not meet the credit requirements to provide a guaranty.  In order to continue to operate under these contracts in Alberta, it looks like our only alternatives at this point are to either provide new LCs or post cash.At the end of November, we expect we will be requested to provide this security.  Please let us know what additional information you will need to consider this request for security.Teresa -----Original Message-----From: 	Joslyn, Kate  Sent:	Friday, November 16, 2001 8:41 AMTo:	Flaman, Derek; Mihalik, TeresaCc:	Poffenroth, Lori; Domingo, Leela; Cross, Darren; Slaughter, Christopher; Hedstrom, Peggy; Powley, BarrySubject:	RE: Enron Direct Canada Corp.

LCs Expiring 12/31/2001Theresa,With respect to Enmax and credit requirements for a guarantor, there are no specific ratings thresholds in the legal documentation (Enmax' Terms and Conditions).  I will work with Kate to ascertain who in Enmax' credit department knows what these specific ratings thresholds are (if any).  Once done, either Kate or I will advise.With respect to general processes surrounding holding cash at a Canadian bank, I know that Enron Canada's policy is to not take cash collateral by wire transfer into a bank account.  The primary reason for this policy involves risks associated with our Personal Property Registration System: to perfect a security interest in a wire transfer requires the registration of a financing statement (multi-jurisdictional, cumbersome); even with such registration one is not guaranteed priority. Again, this is Enron Canada's position with respect to cash collateral; I do not know why Enmax would not accept the C$600, but suspect that their reasons may be the same.  As far as the ""process"" of holding cash at a Canadian bank, I will speak with the relevant operations/credit person (perhaps Lori and/or Cheryl Dawes) and have them contact you.Please let me know if you need further assistance with respect to this matter.Derek -----Original Message-----From: 	Mihalik, Teresa  Sent:	Thursday, November 15, 2001 4:25 PMTo:	Cross, Darren; Joslyn, Kate; Poffenroth, Lori; Domingo, Leela; Flaman, Derek; Powley, BarryCc:	Hedstrom, Peggy; Harris, Molly; Slaughter, Christopher; Brackett, Debbie R.Subject:	Enron Direct Canada Corp.

I will review the FERC filing; however, an Entergy rep called me today to ask for Enron's support stating that the new RTO proposal includes: -- Independent Market Operator (he said such as PJM)-- No Day Ahead Balanced Schedules-- LMP-- One OASIS and one Tariff (no separate tariff for Entergy's ITC)-- One Security Coordinator-- Initial license plate rate within Entergy area-- local planning in Entergy footprint He also said that they are trying to have the GridSouth group agree to use the same Independent Market Operator so there would be one market structure for the Southeast.

This memo addresses the financial reporting requirements Enron will have to its various constituents. During the reorganization, the Company will continue its GAAP reporting, with a breakout of pre and post petition liabilities, as well as historical management/operational reporting, consistent with past practices.In addition, the Company will have an added responsibility to report cash flows to the bankruptcy court and its various constituents.  Specifically, Enron will  be required to report projected cash receipts and cash disbursements by business unit on a weekly basis.  The court and our new debtor-in-possession (""DIP"") lenders require a rolling 13 week projection of cash flows plus monthly projections thereafter to obtain a full year of projected cash flows.  The budgeted weekly projections will then be compared to actual results to determine how well each business unit is operating compared to the projections.  The weekly and monthly forecasts will be adjusted each week pursuant to revised or improved information on forecasted cash flows.  Thus this process will be an ongoing one, with constant updating of information to ensure we generate the most accurate reports possible.The initial weekly and monthly projections will be critical to the determination of the amount that the DIP lenders will be willing to make available to the Company.  In addition, the cash flows for the entities that are included in the bankruptcy proceedings will be utilized by the bankruptcy court and DIP lenders to constantly review and react to the cash flow situation at Enron.  However, all Enron business units (not just ones in bankruptcy) will need to conform to these new requirements, because additional entities are likely to be included in the bankruptcy filing and because it is extremely important for Enron management to be able to see the totality of cash flow requirements for the entire Company.The weekly cash flow projection project will be overseen by Mike Deville (x 57852) and Greg Adams (x 33887).  In addition, Enron has retained Batchelder & Partners, Inc., a financial advisory firm, to assist us in this and other reorganization efforts.We will be having a group meeting with the CAO's and/or their designees from the various business units responsible for the cash projections on Wednesday, December 5 at 2:00 PM in the Boardroom on the 50th floor to further explain this process and answer any questions you may have.  We will then be meeting on an individual basis with the business units to discuss specific business unit requirements.Attached is a template of the financial statement projection format that will be required .  Please review this template in advance of the Wednesday meeting to determine any questions you have on the reporting format.  Obviously the requirements may change, which will require us to reformat and/or obtain additional information on short notification.Thank you in advance for your cooperation.  We look forward to your attendance on Wednesday.",0

(""Enron"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: ENE) common stock during the period between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the ""Class Period""). A copy of the complaint filed in this action is available from the Court, or can be viewed on the firm's website at http://www.classlawyer.com/pr/enron.pdf . The complaint charges that Enron and certain of its officers and directors violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, thereby artificially inflating the price of Enron common stock. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Enron issued a series of statements concerning its business, financial results and operations which failed to disclose (i) that the Company's Broadband Services Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the Company's efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy; (ii) that the Company's operating results were materially overstated as a result of the Company failing to timely write- down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships which were managed by the Company's chief financial officer; and (iii) that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. On October 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market by announcing that the Company was taking non-recurring charges of $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2001, the period ending September 30, 2001. Subsequently, Enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled by Enron's chief financial officer and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. During the Class Period, Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally-held Enron common stock to unsuspecting investors.If you bought Enron common stock between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive, and you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than December 21, 2001.

BUSINESSHeading up --- Trade body to go ahead with conference in QatarFROM THE STAR'S WIRE SERVICES; AP PHOTO10/23/2001The Toronto StarOntarioE02Copyright (c) 2001 The Toronto StarWorld Trade Organization chief Mike Moore says the 142-country body will go ahead with a key conference in Qatar from Nov. 9-13 that he hopes will give a major boost to the ailing global economy. The announcement at a news briefing yesterday in Doha, Qatar, ended weeks of uncertainty over the meeting's venue, which had been thrown into question by security fears, mounting international concern over terrorism and a surge of anti-Western feeling in Muslim countries since the start of U.S. attacks on Afghanistan.""If something seismic or catastrophic happens, we will reconsider, but we are planning to come here in just over two weeks' time,"" Moore said. The focus of the conference will be efforts to launch a new round of negotiations among all member countries to remove many of the remaining barriers to free global trade. 3M's profit sags Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co. says third-quarter profit fell 21 per cent as a slumping global economy reduced sales and workforce cuts increased expenses. Profit fell to $394 million (U.S.), or 99 cents a share, from $499 million, or $1.25, in the year-ago quarter. Sales fell 7.1 per cent to $3.97 billion from $4.27 billion, the company added in a statement yesterday. 3M, which makes products that range from Post-It Notes to circuit boards, has been eliminating 5,000 workers and cutting costs to cope with slowing sales. Copper plunges Copper fell in London yesterday, nearing the lowest price in almost 15 years, on expectations for slowing demand from users such as electronics makers and construction companies. Copper for delivery in three months fell as much as $8 (U.S.) to $1,366 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange, where prices are down 25 per cent this year. A move through the 1999 intraday low of $1,365 will mark the lowest price since February, 1987. Enron information sought Houston-based energy-trading giant Enron Corp. says the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has sought information on company transactions with limited partnerships that were managed by an Enron senior officer. In a statement yesterday, Enron said it will provide the federal regulatory agency with information in response to an inquiry last week. The transactions to ""hedge certain merchant investments and other assets"" took place in 1999 and 2000, according to Enron's 2000 annual report, and resulted in a $16 million (U.S.) pre-tax gain to Enron in 1999 and a $36 million loss in 2000. Enron officials declined to provide details about the transactions or name the limited partnerships. Upset investors sent shares of Enron down $5.40 more than 20 per cent to close at$20.65 in heavy trading in New York. Moulinex takeover okayed A court in the Paris suburb of Nanterre has approved a takeover offer by household-appliance maker Groupe SEB SA for troubled rival Moulinex SA. SEB is expected to retain nearly 3,500 jobs at Moulinex, about half of them in France, the court said yesterday. Moulinex has 8,800 employees worldwide, almost 5,600 of them in France. SEB was to disclose financial details of its offer at a news conference today. Small jets seen on rise Bombardier Inc. chief executive Robert Brown says use of the company's regional jets is actually increasing, even though air traffic is down in North America a crushing 30 per cent since the terrorist attacks in the United States. Brown said yesterday he has ""anecdotal evidence"" that airlines are flying the company's 50-seat jets more often and on more routes because the planes are more efficient than large planes to fly when traffic is light. The trend has not brought new sales, Brown said, but has helped firm up orders for the aircraft that typically take up to more than a year from the date of purchase to delivery. He was speaking at an opening ceremony for Bombardier's vast new aircraft-assembly plant in Mirabel, Que. Aliant shedding jobs Aliant Telecom Inc. plans to reduce its non-unionized workforce by 140 people, the Atlantic region's largest phone company said yesterday. A statement said that 70 of those people will receive retirement packages, but did not indicate when the other 70 employees in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland would lose their jobs or what severance they'd receive.Swissair planes stand on the tarmac at Zurich's Kloten Airport yesterday as Switzerland's government announced a rescue package totalling 4.24 billion Swiss francs, or about $4 billion (Canadian).

MONEYInside MoneySEC INQUIRY OF ENRON RATTLES STOCKAssociated Press10/23/2001Orlando SentinelMETROB5(Copyright 2001 by The Orlando Sentinel)HOUSTON -- Shares of Enron Corp. plunged Monday after the energy trading giant said the Securities and Exchange Commission had sought information about the company's transactions with limited partnerships, which were managed by an Enron senior officer. In a statement, Enron said it had provided the regulatory agency with information in response to an inquiry last week.""We welcome this request,"" Enron chairman and chief executive officer Kenneth L. Lay said Monday. ""We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest."" Investors were upset by the news, however, sending shares of Enron down $5.40 to close at $20.65 on the New York Stock Exchange. The transactions took place in 1999 and 2000, according to Houston- based Enron's 2000 annual report. They resulted in a $16 million pre- tax gain to Enron in 1999 and a $36 million loss in 2000. Enron officials would not provide details about the transactions or identify the limited partnerships, instead referring questions to a section of the annual report on related party transactions. ""Enron entered into transactions with [limited partnerships] to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets,"" according to the section. Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the SEC first contacted Enron last week and described the request is an ""informal inquiry."" ""This is not an investigation,"" he said. ""We see the request as an opportunity to put this issue behind us."" SEC spokesman John Heine said he could not comment on the filings. The electricity marketer and natural gas provider says both internal and external auditors and attorneys reviewed the arrangements, the company's board was fully informed of and approved them, and they were disclosed in the company's SEC filings.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron Keeps Analysts Happy as Investors Flee: Call of the Day2001-10-23 17:08 (New York)Enron Keeps Analysts Happy as Investors Flee: Call of the Day     New York, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Over lunch in a conferenceroom at Boston's Four Seasons Hotel last Thursday, Enron Corp.Chairman Kenneth Lay tried to convince analysts and investors thatthe company has no more surprises.     With the analysts, he apparently succeeded. Enron remains oneof Wall Street's most highly rated stocks, even after the largestenergy trader acknowledged that transactions with partnerships runby its chief financial officer led to a writedown of $1.2 billionin shareholder equity.     Lay wasn't so successful with investors, who have abandonedEnron shares, slashing their value 42 percent in a week.     ``You've got a lot of people lining up to say the emperor hasno clothes,'' said Richard Gross of Lehman Brothers Inc., whotoday repeated his ``strong buy'' rating on Enron. Analysts atCredit Suisse First Boston, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and other firmshave also kept their highest ratings on Enron.     Gross still likes the look of Enron's finery. ``The corefranchise here is very valuable,'' he said, and the stock'sdecline more than reflects the ``worst case'' for the company.     In Boston and at similar meetings in Houston and New York,Lay had to explain the unwinding of the partnerships. He and otherEnron executives assured investors the company has no moresurprises in store, according to Greg Phelps, who manages $1.1billion at John Hancock Advisers Inc., and attended the Bostonsession.     The partnerships functioned somewhat like private equityfunds, according to analysts and investors, and includedinvestments that lost money. The Securities and ExchangeCommission has asked for more information about them, Enron saidyesterday.                        One Hold, One Sell     While two analysts have cut their Enron ratings afterlearning about the partnerships, they only dented the company'spopularity on Wall Street.     Michael Heim of A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis loweredhis rating to ``hold'' from ``buy'' on Friday. He said he has beenlooking for discussion of the partnerships in Enron's SEC filingsand is only seeing ``vague references'' that don't leave him witha ``good comfort level.''     With Heim's rating change, Enron went from being the secondmost highly rated stock in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index to the10th, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.     Today, Zach Wagner at Edward Jones & Co. in St. Louis cutEnron to ``reduce'' from ``accumulate.'' Ratings by Edward Jones,which caters to individual investors rather than institutions,aren't tracked by First Call.     First Call translates analyst ratings into numbers, with``strong buy'' a one, ``buy'' a two, and so on, then averages theratings to rank a company's Wall Street popularity. The mosthighly rated stock is Tyco International Ltd., which has fallen 12percent this year.     Enron shares fell 86 cents to $19.79 today.                        Remaining Skeptical     However highly brokerage analysts rate the stock, ``I have toremain skeptical,'' said Barry Borak, energy analyst at David L.Babson & Co., which manages $60 billion in Cambridge,Massachusetts.     ``There's been a huge loss of management credibility atEnron,'' Borak said, because of the partnerships and theunexpected departure in August of Jeffrey Skilling, who had heldthe post of chief executive officer for six months and was heirapparent to Lay. ``Nobody I've talked to thinks (Skilling'sdeparture) is for personal reasons,'' Borak said.     Skilling helped transform Enron from a gas pipeline companyinto the biggest energy trading company. Enron also owns powerplants in deregulated markets.     Borak said Babson doesn't own Enron shares and won't be abuyer ``until I can get better, more thorough information aboutwhat else might pop up in the future.''     Borak and other investors said Enron has a reputation for notproviding enough information about its businesses, and they saidthis makes the positive view of the company on Wall Street moredifficult to understand.     After Skilling resigned, Lay said the company would be moreopen about its businesses. A bullet point in his talk in Bostonwas ``increased transparency of financial and operating results,''according to a handout provided at the Boston meeting.                         Amazed, Dismayed     Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale wrote in anote to clients last week that she was ``amazed at the willingnessof Enron's management to break out earnings and expenses to thedegree that it disclosed in the third quarter.''     Coale also wrote that she was ``dismayed by the apparent`disguise' of the additional $1.2 billion equity hit that was notdisclosed in (Enron's) press release and was briefly mentioned inthe earnings conference call.'' Coale kept her rating on Enron at``buy.''     Phelps at John Hancock said that his ``cynical side''believes that investment banking business has helped keep WallStreet recommending Enron stock. ``They provide some goodunderwriting business,'' he said.     Credit Suisse First Boston managed a secondary sale of 12million Enron shares in 1999, with Lehman Brothers actingas co-manager. Credit Suisse has also managed bond sales forEnron this year.Enron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1)2001-10-23 16:38 (New York)Enron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1)     (Updates with closing share price in sixth paragraph.)     New York, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the biggestenergy trader, has asked Citigroup Inc. to arrange a $750 millionloan, ensuring access to credit if the company is cut off frommoney markets, say people familiar with the matter.     Enron's shares and bonds plunged yesterday after the companysaid the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating itsfinances. The company depends on a $3 billion commercial paper, orshort-term debt, program to finance day-to-day operations.     Moody's Investors Service last week placed all $13 billion ofthe company's long-term debt securities on watch for possibledowngrade. Any drop in the rating may cut off Enron from thecommercial paper market, raising the costs of short-term debt.     ``We understand that our credit rating is critical to boththe capital markets and our counterparties,'' Enron's ChiefFinancial Officer Andrew Fastow said on a conference call today.He said Enron has $3.5 billion available on bank credit lines,giving it enough cash to operate normally.     Dan Noonan, a spokesman for Citigroup's Citibank NA unit,declined to comment. Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, alsowouldn't comment.     Shares of Enron, based in Houston, fell 86 cents to $19.79.They have fallen 76 percent this year.                         Complex Financing     An investor sued Enron last week, saying dealings with twopartnerships run by Fastow, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,cost the company $35 million. The suit also calls Fastow'sleadership of the partnerships, set up to remove debt from Enron'sbooks, a conflict of interest.     Enron bought back 62 million shares to unwind positions insome partnerships run by Fastow, said Chief Executive Officer KenLay on the conference call with investors today.     The number of shares differs from a Wall Street Journalreport on Thursday that said Enron had bought back 55 millionshares. The buyback reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion,the Journal said.     The company set up the partnerships and other affiliatedcompanies to buy Enron assets such as power plants. Thepartnerships allow Enron to take debt off its books, letting itborrow to invest in its main business of commodities trading,Enron said. Enron trades electricity, natural gas, oil, coal andother commodities.     ```They have complex off-balance sheet financing,'' saidCommerzbank analyst Andre Mead. ``It's difficult to ascertain thefull impact on shareholders.''     The SEC has asked Enron about partnerships and affiliatedcompanies headed by Fastow. The company has at least $3 billion insuch ``off-the-books'' financing in affiliated companies, RayNiles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report toinvestors.                      Depends on Asset Sales     One partnership, Whitewing Management, owns 250,000 preferredshares that Enron may have to convert to common stock. Whitewingpartners can demand their preferred shares be converted if Enroncommon stock falls below a certain price or if Enron's creditrating drops under investment grade.     Whitewing and other Enron partnerships and trusts includecompany executives as officers and directors, according to recordsfrom the Texas secretary of state.     ``Over the life of these trust structures, Enron has in factissued a sizable amount of equity,'' Enron Treasurer Ben Gilsansaid. Most of that was shares issued to Enron executives as partof a deferred compensation plan, Gilsan said.     The Whitewing partnership was financed with $1.4 billion inbonds sold last year. The partnership used some of the proceeds tobuy Enron power plants and plans to retire the debt by sellingthem, officials said on the conference call. Other companypartnerships operate with the same strategy.     ``Some investors are worried the asset sales won't cover thefull amount (borrowed), and Enron will have to furnish support tothe detriment of shareholders,'' said Commerzbank analyst Meade.                      Commercial Paper Rates     Enron was paying 3.15 percent to issue commercial paper untilOct. 31, which is as much as 15 basis points more than companieswith the same ``A2/P2'' short-term credit ratings that are not oncredit watch. Enron's short-term debt is not on review for apossible downgrade.     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels aboveinvestment grade. Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's rate thecompany's debt at investment grade.     Enron has previously turned to Citigroup for finance andadvice. In 1999, Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit advised thecompany on its $1.45 billion acquisition of three natural gas-fired power plants from Cogen Technologies Inc. Citibank, alongwith J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., this year arranged a $1.75 billionloan.How Enron Blew ItTexas MonthlyNovember 2001Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: money, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the most important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is bearish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?by Mimi Swartz http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like the international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil companies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with modernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, brown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. They are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Republic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the building intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E tipped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratulating Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between elevator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: ""From the World's Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!""For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself from a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 percent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 billion to $100 billion. ""The very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"" notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business.This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determined to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, Enron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorporation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If you were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first crack. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. The company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech world, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, ""was a great marriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking mentality of the financial markets.""The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the end of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the American economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but the best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those who could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a company couldn't possibly go wrong.Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of $80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's energy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant project in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the change in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD ""a totally different way of thinking about business-we got it."" At Enron, in fact, you either ""got it"" or you were gone-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that the color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white marble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skilling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after just six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (General Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in America (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, ""someone could actually get killed."" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas morning. ""I had no idea what I'd let go of,"" Skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron. From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands of working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorced, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher. He almost missed his brother's wedding. ""Learning a foreign language-I never learned a foreign language!"" he exclaims. He never once took his youngest son to school. ""I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifteen-minute scheduling."" Travel: ""You can't go to Africa for a week and get anything out of it!"" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. ""I'm not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,"" he says, finally. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains its pragmatic edge. ""It would have been easy to stay,"" he says. ""But that would not have been good for me."" He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, handsome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation ""bizarre"" and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put upon. ""I'm surprised,"" he says, ""that people have so much trouble understanding this.""PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early nineties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine to five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in those days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with that scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation?But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a volatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG was then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doctoral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the Vietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwardly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, HNG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the state of Texas.HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover attempts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled ""the purchase"" was being called ""the merger"" back in Houston, and before long, following some particularly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gravity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was running a new company called Enron. ""Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future,"" says one person associated with Enron at that time. ""He never fought change. He embraced change.""Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got started. LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling had spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, Illinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) ""I liked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,"" he told BusinessWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call ""intellectual capital."" He loved being smart, and he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Methodist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and took on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985. It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an investment bank would.Skilling worked up some numbers and found them ""absolutely compelling."" Then the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron executives. He had a one-page presentation. ""Almost to a person,"" Skilling says, ""they thought it was stupid."" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dejected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and then said, ""Let's go.""The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of those divides that seem to define his life: ""I believed this whole world would be different, a huge breakthrough"" is the way Skilling puts it today, and even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, ""We were in."" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enron as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just for him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit. After that, says Skilling, ""we never looked back.""Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it had a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the best access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but with startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined.THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had made: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading business. The idea was to build a ""knowledge-based business,"" which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Most were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most of them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. ""Enron was going to create a niche for itself or die,"" one former executive explains. ""The people who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had narrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.""Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the smartest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First Boston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be ""aggressive."" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization. You could see what he was looking for on ""Super Saturdays"" at the Houston headquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving ability, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called ""a sense of urgency."" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were the types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Maybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flung suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-and-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the globe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A company concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning the house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enron never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they could use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Program. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until ten at night. ""They were so cutting edge,"" rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time. ""They really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going.""Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that those titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonuses-with no cap. ""If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could make a lot of money,"" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years until resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband division. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or off-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a spectacular Mexican villa. ""Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'd say,"" one loyalist says. And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas merchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the buzzword was ""aggressive,"" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay believed the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business. Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they began barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly service areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who were somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying efforts).But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $2 billion to $7 billion. ""Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,"" the New York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skilling had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming another.""FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"" sang the New York Times in 1999. ""In the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,"" crowed Fortune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetable, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to discover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, steel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn?But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech communications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline became another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades online in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enron, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empty lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. ""Its strategy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,"" BusinessWeek insisted.There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of customer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had to come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them ""counterparties.""Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were maximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk venture quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oil-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its markets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all. While many businesses used what was known in the industry as ""mark-to-market accounting,"" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The company priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't get deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. However many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called ""subjective accounting,"" investors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the market fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't going to be high enough. ""Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,"" says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a contribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's competing literacy charity: ""Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,"" he says.As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the Enron family put it, ""It became a company full of mercenaries."" The change started at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported overhearing orders like ""I need a smart person-go buy me one"" or ""Buy me an intelligent slave, quick."" Enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-parody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was too disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by Skilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and those with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname quickly became ""rank and yank."") It was a point of pride that Skilling's division replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling associate put it, ""Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store."" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enron's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' attitude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading culture, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enron higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World, he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere.Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: ""They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future,"" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close deals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-ups who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase ""No old tapes"" became an Enron clich?. ""People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,"" says one former Enron executive.In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company. E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, one for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture this way: ""They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death.""BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: Just as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enron's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building projects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. ""It wasn't the time for long-term approaches,"" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood. ""It was the technology era.""To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebecca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many years the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her nickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had the requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of Enron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent of Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-one Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate America.But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, India, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron way: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 percent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three changes in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and other Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisions were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firing lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relentless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keeping a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company as smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disaster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mark her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water utility that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water privatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greatest water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like another sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million. But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not like gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, and confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much diminished, was folded into Enron. ""I think it's best for Rebecca to start afresh,"" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal. Or as one critic put it, ""They were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business."" As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable: ""The best time for the succession to occur is when the company is doing well,"" he told the press. ""Enron is doing extremely well now."" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debacle. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (Lay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to George W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in California, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its weaknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in January.Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situation was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had. ""For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us,"" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corporate communications. ""We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the White House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his biggest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take care of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis."" (California utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's all too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a joke comparing California with the Titanic. (""At least the Titanic went down with its lights on."")But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billion in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too did the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first time in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to market. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds, Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, the stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. During the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who challenged Enron's financial reporting an ""asshole."" When the company reported hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling promised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. ""There wasn't any positive news,"" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says now. ""Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.""The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had asked in March whether Enron was overpriced. (""Start with a pretty straightforward question: How exactly does Enron make its money?"") The routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken Lay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Journal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife within the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possible failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutionally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. ""When Wall Street is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,"" says Carol Coale. ""When a company falls out of favor, all these issues carry more weight.""This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways. ""It just created an attitude,"" one executive still at Enron says. ""If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? There was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"" Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardship duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. ""But,"" as one Houston oilman explains, ""if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporation that's better suited for good times than bad.""As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employees killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for him, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but ""innovate much closer to our core."" As for the culture: ""Things like the Performance Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to categorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a morale problem.""That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure with Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always believed in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble, it was different. ""Even Jeff's biggest detractors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,"" one loyalist admits.But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. ""Look,"" he says with finality, ""ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my interests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.""Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new technologies. ""The first wave never gets it right,"" he says. ""The stand-alone dot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world."" Houston, he promises, will become the world's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In fact, he is already shopping for office space.""This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,"" he says, almost breathless. ""There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that get it.""Enron Fails to Smooth Things OverBy Peter Eavis mailto:peavis@thestreet.comSenior ColumnistTheStreet.com10/23/2001 01:07 PM EDTURL: http://www.thestreet.com/markets/detox/10002864.htmlEnron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) held a special conference call Tuesday to address investor concerns that have weighed heavily on its stock. But worries may persist after the energy trader offered few new details and the CEO publicly sparred with a gadfly investor over a shadowy off-balance sheet transaction. The transaction that has drawn most attention in the past week is a complex financing that Enron entered into with a partnership called LJM2, which was led by Enron's finance chief Andrew Fastow. Terminating this arrangement led to a $1.2 billion equity reduction in the third quarter. Monday, Enron stock plunged 20% after the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission is probing ""related party transactions."" Executives declined to respond to questions about Fastow's role in the LJM2 partnership on the Tuesday call. Another key issue is the impact of the equity reduction. The company said on the call that its share count would decline by 60 million in the fourth quarter, due to the termination of the LJM2 financing. But CEO Ken Lay said the company wouldn't be increasing its earnings guidance of $1.80 a share for 2001 and $2.15 for 2002. When a share count drops, earnings per share should normally increase, assuming the earnings number stays constant. The 60 million shares are equivalent to about 6.5% of the company's diluted total in the third quarter. As a result, Enron should have raised its per-share profits forecast by about that much, assuming constant earnings. When asked on the call if earnings per share guidance would be increasing, CEO Lay replied that the company had previously increased its guidance for this year. He then affirmed the 2002 number. Now, to be fair, Enron may not be forecasting lower earnings. The planned reduction in shares may simply bring the total share count back close to a level in the fourth quarter and 2002 that analysts had originally expected. Notably, the share count in the third quarter jumped by 20 million, meaning a fourth-quarter reduction might not change matters that much. Alternatively, Enron may beat fourth-quarter estimates by 6.5%; perhaps the company has simply chosen not to increase guidance at this stage, given uncertainties in the economy. In any case, more clarity on this matter is clearly needed. Calls to Enron weren't immediately returned. The stock edged up 2% Tuesday after falling nearly 40% since last week amid worries about complex off-balance sheet deals. The call, arranged after Enron's Monday plunge, contained a lot of queries about two trusts, called Marlin II and Whitewing, against which Enron borrowed some $3.4 billion. Lay became testy after questioning by Richard Grubman of Boston-based hedge fund Highfields Capital Management. Grubman, who was called an ""a--hole"" by Enron's former CEO Jeff Skilling on an April conference call, was trying to find out the value of water assets held by Marlin II. The optimal way of paying back money borrowed through the trust is to sell the water assets. Grubman's line of questioning implied that the Marlin assets were worth only about $100 million, meaning Enron would have to find about $900 million to pay off the Marlin II-related debt. Grubman arrived at $100 million after factoring in what he saw as the effects of a third-quarter writedown to water assets, some of which are included in Marlin II. Lay disputed the $100 million number. At one point, he accused Grubman of driving Enron's stock down and monopolizing the Tuesday conference call. In the middle of Grubman's comments, Lay told the call operator to go to the next caller. Grubman didn't immediately return a call seeking comment. If Enron has to find $900 million, this can be done by issuing stock or raising cash on its balance sheet. If the latter route is taken, Enron says it's likely to use asset sales to generate the cash. Enron executives said liquidity would be sufficient and detailed at least $3.35 billion in available credit lines. But if Enron's debt-to-capital ratio exceeds 65%, the covenants on some of those lines are broken. After the $1.2 billion equity writedown and other charges taken in the third quarter, that ratio is probably about 50%-55% (Enron hasn't released a third-quarter balance sheet to arrive at an exact calculation). It would take $3 billion in further writedowns or charges to push Enron's debt-to-capital ratio up to 65%. Stocks More Static For Enron Forbes.com staff, Forbes.com10.23.01, 11:15 AM ET NEW YORK - Enron scrambled again to reassure investors this morning, after it disclosed yesterday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had asked for information on partnerships run by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives. Enron (nyse: ENE ) last week reported a third-quarter loss of $638 million after taking $1.01 billion in charges on ill-fated investments. The market took that in stride until media reports parsed the earnings announcement and disclosed that $35 million of those losses were connected with the two limited partnerships run by Fastow. Enron shares, which plunged 23% last week, nosedived another 21% yesterday. Enron bounced back slightly in morning trading. The turmoil makes it clearer than ever that the energy trader's problems weren't solved by the recent departure of Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling. AES Says Indian State Interfering In Ops, Complains To PM10/23/2001Dow Jones International News(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW DELHI (AP)--After Enron Corp. it is the turn of U.S.-based AES Corp. to seek the Indian prime minister's help to settle its grievances with a state government. In a letter to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, AES Corp.'s President Dennis W. Bakke said his company's determination to continue in India was being tested by the government of eastern Orissa state.The letter, a copy of which was made available to the Associated Press Tuesday, was dated Oct. 1 and appeared to have been faxed to the office of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The Virginia-based energy company operates two power plants in Orissa, holds 49% of the Orissa Power Generation Corp. and manages the main power distribution company in the state. AES Corp. is the other major American power company besides Enron Corp. to have made big investments in India after the government allowed foreign investment in the power sector in the early 1990s. In his letter, Bakke drew Vajpayee's attention to the ""expropriation, repeated contract violations, intimidation ... and direct interference with day-to-day management"" by the state government and its agencies. The letter also complained about government-run agencies failing to pay 2.1 billion rupees ($1=INR47.985) in bills. ""If the situation faced by AES is not remedied urgently, it will undermine the trust and confidence of foreign investors in India,"" Bakke wrote. ""While AES still remains committed to India as a country it would very much like to serve, our determination to continue is being tested."" The prime minister's office said it wasn't ready to comment on the report. Officials of the Orissa state government weren't available to respond to Bakke's charges in view of a Hindu festival. AES Corp. has already offered to withdraw from the distribution company - known as the Central Electricity Supply Company of Orissa. However, it has said that the company will continue with its interests in electricity generation. If AES Corp. decides to pull out completely, it will the third American company to do so. Cogentrix Inc. quit a power project in southern India before it was started, while Houston-based Enron is in the process of withdrawing from the Dabhol Power Project in western Maharashtra state, India's biggest ever foreign investment project. On Sept. 14, Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay wrote a letter to Vajpayee threatening legal action to pursue claims of up to $5 billion relating to the Dabhol Power Co. dispute and questioned India's ability to honor its contracts. Lay had also warned that India may find it hard to attract foreign investors in the future because of the payment dispute with the Dabhol project, which stopped production and construction in May.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.NEW DELHI, India (AP) - The U.S.-based operator of two Indian power plants is seeking the help of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in its battle against alleged corporate intimidation leveled by local government authorities. AES Corp. President Dennis W. Bakke addressed the concerns in an Oct. 1 letter to Vajpayee, obtained Tuesday by the Associated Press.In the letter, the Virginia-based energy company cited the ""expropriation, repeated contract violations, intimidation ... and direct interference with day-to-day management"" by the local government in the Indian state of Orissa. AES operates two power plants in Orissa, holds 49 percent of the Orissa Power Generation Corp. and manages the main power distribution company in the state. The complaint follows a similar appeal made to Vajpayee on Sept. 14 by Enron Corp., the only other major U.S. power company to make big investments in India after the government allowed foreign investment in the power sector in the early 1990s. In that case, Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay threatened legal action to pursue claims of up to dlrs 5 billion over a dispute with the Dabhol Power Co., and questioned India's ability to honor contracts. The prime minister's office said it was not ready to comment AES's complaint. Officials of the Orissa state government were not available to respond to Bakke's charges. ""If the situation faced by AES is not remedied urgently, it will undermine the trust and confidence of foreign investors in India,"" Bakke wrote. ""While AES still remains committed to India as a country it would very much like to serve, our determination to continue is being tested.""

"The objective seems to have gotten alittle lost here.We want the terms to be firm and as specific as the version we had on Friday (although I take point about arbitration and vesting of rest stock - although we have to insert something in here).

I made some good friends at Enron, but I know I won't see many of them again. Enron took those friendships, Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office, they took the free sodas and the big screen TVs and the foosball table. They took away the free dinners we got on Friday nights during the new releases to the Web site. They took away the admin who always teased me because I ate like a pig and never gained weight.

"We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setupDemonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next weekNature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systemsTraders and Originators:Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.Information Technology:Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk booksWill ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.Next steps Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.SummaryThis simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

"Attached please find the proposed Electronic Trading Agreement and Password Application for Netco.  I have included a clean copy of each document as well as a red-lined copy marked against the version sent to Mark Taylor by Dave and Carl.  You will note that I have made a number of changes to the original EOL documents.   1.  The Password Application. The Password Application contains no substantive changes.  I advise that we retain the original description of the website as a platform for the ""purchase and sale of products and instruments based on energy products or other commodities (including derivative products)"".  The description is sufficiently broad to cover any potential expansion beyond the original gas and power products, as well as third party product offerings.  After a brief discussion regarding the auction platform with Louise, I revised the PA to reinsert references to the auction. 2.  The Electronic Trading Agreement. There are numerous revisions and additions to the ETA.  I outline below a few of the key changes requiring your consideration: a.  I added a sentence at the end of Section 1 to make clear that in the event the ETA conflicted with any other agreement between the parties, including any terms posted on the Website, the ETA controls. b.  I added a new Section 2(h) to address Counterparty content posted on any public area of the Website.  To the extent that we anticipate such a capability in the future, it may be a good idea to include such a provision.  If we do include this section, do we want to limit our license of the content to use on the Website and related materials, as proposed here?  If you do not want to include such a limitation, we can add the word ""worldwide"" to the first sentence before the word ""royalty-free"" and delete the balance of the final sentence after the phrase ""not distorted by displaying only a part)"". c.  I revised Section 3(e) to clarify that Netco is not required to send written confirmations of on-line transactions and to provide that electronic records are admissible as evidence of the transaction.  The last sentence of the section is intended to make clear that to the extent the master agreement requires a written confirmation, such master agreement controls, provided that the failure to send a confirmation will not invalidate the transaction. d.  I added a new Section 4 to address transactions posted by unaffiliated third parties.  (This issue was already covered in the last paragraph of the original PA.) e.  I revised Section 5(a) to clarify that Netco is not liable for any direct damages and to expressly cap its damages to amounts paid by Counterparty for accessing the Website. f.  I revised Section 5(b) and (c) in response to issues raised by many counterparties when I negotiated EOL ETA issues.  g.  Section 6(a) has been revised to expressly provide that Confidential Information excludes counterparty identifying information, as well as transactional or biographical information in statistical form.  Please let me know if you disagree with the scope of this exclusion.  If you don't want to exclude counterpary identifying information, we can merely delete the phrase ""the identification of Counterpartt as a user of the Website and shall also exclude"".  I added a 1-year term following expiration of the ETA to the confidentiality obligation in Section 6(d), reasoning that most of the confidential information protected by this Section belongs to the Counterparty, not Netco, and thus desiring some cut off point for our obligation to maintain confidentiality.  A number of our counterparties enter into transaction by and through service companies or agents.  I have prepared a revised Password Application, side letter to the ETA, and Consent and Acknowledgment form to be utilized by such counterparties and attach these documents below for your review and reference as well. Please give me a call with any questions or comments. Regards, Leslie(713) 853-6121 (o)(713) 256-0572 (cell)(713) 528-5215 (home)",0
"Kal came up with a couple of suggestions:	""TraderKey""	""QuotesKey""	- Consistent with other UBS products (like Swisskey)	- Few syllables	- Doesn't use the UBS name, so shouldn't be as sensitive to the name police	- Is generic enough to survive UBS name changes or other companies posting products on the site in the future.	- Are available as a URLI especially like ""Traderkey"", which has positive connotations and provides potential for some interesting marketing campaigns.Dave",0
"Louise,Three questions/issues which I'd appreciate your feedback on:1) I am planning to arrange for a meeting with gas and power originators/traders tomorrow to let them know what we are planning with the top 50 customers (sending draft PA's) and enlist their support for calls where we can leverage their relationships with the customers.2) After some more thought, I'm on the fence about sending out the PA's without names. The following occurs to me:	- Sending them out on Tuesday is only three days before we know what the final name will be	- Sending them out with the final name probably helps our credibility	- The PA/ETA is a very simple form; customers probably don't require the extra three days to review them.	- Following the public release of our new Buyers' identity with the first release of the PA helps build a bit more excitement than otherwise.3) I understand you are objecting to the provision which would allow us to release a customers' name to another company. I don't think most customers would object to this and getting the provisions in up front gives us more flexibility later. Can we keep this in?Thanks,Dave",0

"Looks good.  I need to find a different version of Code of Conduct that more closely mimics EPMI and PGE version.  The agreement in Appendix B right now may be too restrictive for our current dealings.   Agree that we need to finish up details of (a) data transfer and (b) transistional services agreement. In my discussions on Friday, the transitional services will be ""agent"" type activities.  Enron needs help in making sure that it can service its contracts.  No UBS Warburg Energy employee will make commercial decisions for Enron - simply perform directed activities.

The basis of the proposal is that:1.	 AEP would take on all costs, risks, liens, etc. associated with the Coastline law suite (low case $1.8MM, expected case $2.5MM).  2.	Enron would forego 1 months of interest due to AEP's failure to get DoJ approval ($2.1MM).Benefits to Enron:1.	Potential savings in Enron expense vs. AEP's ability to capitalize the cost.2.	Enron still retains the ""DoJ stick"" in that interest payments start on 1 June instead of 1 May.  3.	Enron saves time and legal costs not having to defend against the claim.  4.	Enron does not have to wrestle with AEP to get access to HPL staff who are involved in the suite.  (even though AEP is obligated to make resources available to help us with the claim, AEP will have no incentive to do so after the sale).

"At the end of the Leadership Giving Campaign, EWS had reached $488,832 in pledges, which is 38.31% of our campaign goal of $1,276,000.  Enron's plan calls for Leadership Givers to represent 60% of the total pledge goal, so we are short 21.69% or $276,768.  Even more disappointing was the weak 7.85% participation rate by those employees in the Leadership level (i.e., over $90,000 in base pay).  While part of this shortfall was caused by the decision not to conduct a Leadership campaign for EBS, most of the other business units/functional groups in EWS did not fare too well either.

"To the Executive Committee:Attached is a note that has been sent to our managers regarding off-site and team-building meetings.  My impression is that our commendable efforts to build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get-togethers that require substantial travel.  Our challenge is that such gatherings are far more costly and time-consuming for us to attend than our Houston colleagues might realize.  Often, participating in these meetings takes an entire week for Enron Europe employees (especially if they are outside of Texas). Naturally, they may feel that this time of year (PRC time) is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering.These off-sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter, which compounds the difficulty; worse still are the times they occur at the end of Q2, since it also coincides and conflicts with the PRC process.I would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs (both direct and indirect) when inviting international employees to off-site meetings in the US.  We appreciate the chance to be included in the broader Enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizations, but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expenses.Thanks!John Sherriff(Letter sent to all Enron Europe VPs and direct reports)We still have issues regarding Offsites and 'Team Building' exercises.  In particular, we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform other key work groups when workplace absences are pending.In order to avoid misunderstandings, and to increase transparency, the following will apply with immediate effect:Any Offsite or 'Team Building' exercise which any group (both commercial and non-commercial, and including John and myself)intends to undertake must be communicated, in advance, to all department heads. Issue to be identified include:  all participants who will out of the office, total costs of the exercise; and, where appropriate, work load coverage details.John and I are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends. To the extent that is not possible, we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is appropriately covered.Trips to Houston and especially resorts in the US are far more difficult to justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved.  So please pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel.Please communicate this policy to your staff.Michael Brown",0

Technology bellwethers Intel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. , which reported sharply lower profits, did little to buck the downward trend.FirstEnergy Corp. , an owner of electric utilities in northern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected 18 percent increase in earnings, citing increased electricity sales and lower costs. Mining company Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. reported a third-quarter profit that reversed a year-earlier loss, due to higher gold production. Yet such good news is proving more the exception than the rule. Top chipmaker Intel said on Tuesday after the close of exchanges that profits tumbled 77 percent as it suffered from slowing global economies and weak personal computer sales. PC maker IBM announced its first quarterly earnings decline since the end of 1999 as weak sales continued to weigh on profits. Energy giant Enron Corp. posted a quarterly loss after taking $1.01 billion in charges. Companies from a range of industries reported profit shortfalls, including Caterpillar Inc. , the world's largest maker of construction equipment, and Unisys Corp. , a computer company. ""The earnings season is one that the market has digested and in some cases predigested as being just ugly, and therefore horrible or ugly results are not met with surprise at this point,"" said Michael Holland, who runs the $65 million Holland Balanced Fund. FOCUS NOT ON EARNINGS ""The focus (for investors) has been and continues to be outside of earnings, that is, the war on terrorism specifically,"" he said. Dynegy Inc. , a natural gas and power marketer and trader, on Monday said third-quarter earnings rose 62 percent as its backbone wholesale energy business nearly doubled its returns. While Enron posted a loss, it reported that its profit excluding charges rose 35 percent due to strong performance in its core energy business. ""Energy companies manage to earn pretty good money even when prices are down,"" said Jon Burnham, portfolio manager for the $170 million Burnham Fund. ""These are good, well-financed companies."" Caterpillar helped to lead a litany of earnings woes. The Peoria, Illinois-based company on Tuesday said its third-quarter earnings fell 5 percent because of higher expenses and less efficient manufacturing. The company also said it expects fourth-quarter revenues to be down slightly from the year-ago quarter, with full-year profit down 10 percent to 15 percent. It blamed economic uncertainty in the wake of last month's attacks for the expected shortfall, but added that 2002 sales will be at least flat to up slightly from 2001 levels. Unisys on Monday reported its third-quarter profits plunged by 50 percent due to weakening demand for high-end server computers and systems integration work. It said it would cut 3,000 jobs and slashed its fourth-quarter outlook. TAKING GRIM TIDINGS IN STRIDE Other companies that have reported profit drops include Novellus Systems Inc. , a maker of semiconductor production equipment, and Charles Schwab Corp. , the top U.S. discount brokerage. Schwab said Tuesday that quarterly earnings fell 51 percent as customers avoided stocks all summer, although a surge in September trading pointed to better times ahead. Money managers are taking the grim profit tidings in stride. ""Most of these earnings situations are in these stocks,"" said Burnham.

USA: Energy permits some light in gloomy profit season.By Per Jebsen10/16/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.NEW YORK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Energy and mining companies provided a few glimmers of light but otherwise third-quarter results on Monday and Tuesday are helping to fulfill expectations for the worst quarter in 10 years. FirstEnergy Corp., an owner of electric utilities in northern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected 18 percent increase in earnings, citing increased electricity sales and lower costs. Mining company Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. reported a third-quarter profit that reversed a year-earlier loss, due to higher gold production.Yet such good news is proving more the exception than the rule. Energy giant Enron Corp..ENE) posted a quarterly loss after taking $1.01 billion in charges. Companies from a range of industries reported profit shortfalls, including Caterpillar Inc., the world's largest maker of construction equipment, and Unisys Corp., a computer company. ""The earnings season is one that the market has digested and in some cases predigested as being just ugly, and therefore horrible or ugly results are not met with surprise at this point,"" said Michael Holland, who runs the $65 million Holland Balanced Fund. ""The focus (for investors) has been and continues to be outside of earnings, that is, the war on terrorism specifically,"" he said. Investors are likely to pay attention to the earnings reports from tech bellwethers International Business Machines Corp., a computer maker, and chipmaker Intel Corp.. These are scheduled to be released on Tuesday after the close of trading. Dynegy Inc., a natural gas and power marketer and trader, on Monday said third-quarter earnings rose 62 percent as its backbone wholesale energy business nearly doubled its returns. While Enron posted a loss, it reported that its profit excluding charges rose 35 percent due to strong performance in its core energy business. ""Energy companies manage to earn pretty good money even when prices are down,"" said Jon Burnham, portfolio manager for the $170 million Burnham Fund. ""These are good, well-financed companies."" Caterpillar helped to lead a litany of earnings woes. The Peoria, Illinois-based company on Tuesday said its third-quarter earnings fell 5 percent because of higher expenses and less efficient manufacturing. The company also said it expects fourth-quarter revenues to be down slightly from the year-ago quarter, with full-year profit down 10 percent to 15 percent. It blamed economic uncertainty in the wake of last month's attacks for the expected shortfall, but added that 2002 sales will be at least flat to up slightly from 2001 levels. Unisys on Monday reported its third-quarter profits plunged by 50 percent due to weakening demand for high-end server computers and systems integration work. It said it would cut 3,000 jobs and slashed its fourth-quarter outlook. Other companies that have reported profit drops include Novellus Systems Inc., a maker of semiconductor production equipment, and Charles Schwab Corp., the top U.S. discount brokerage. Schwab said Tuesday that quarterly earnings fell 51 percent as customers avoided stocks all summer, although a surge in September trading pointed to better times ahead. Money managers are taking the grim profit tidings in stride. ""Most of these earnings situations are in these stocks,"" said Burnham. ""Barring unforeseens in the national and international situation, the market should work its way higher over the next 6 to 9 months."" ""Whatever earnings are in this quarter isn't going to matter too much, except in cases where they're considerably better than expected or worse,"" he said.

USA: INTERVIEW-Enron says may partner or sell broadband business.10/16/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.HOUSTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Energy giant Enron Corp. said on Tuesday it is reviewing strategic options for its loss-making broadband telecommunications business, which could involve selling the business or finding a partner. ""In addition to us looking at our business on a standalone business, we clearly have entertained some discussions on other possibilities,"" Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay told Reuters in a telephone interview.Earlier on Tuesday, Enron reported that one-time charges of $1.01 billion for broadband and other businesses outside its core energy operations pushed the company to a third-quarter net loss of $638 million, its first quarterly loss in more than four years. Future options for the broadband business include ""sale, partnership, all kinds of possibilities"" he said. ""We still think over time that it will be a valuable business,"" Lay said, but for now the broadband market is in a ""total meltdown"", he added. Enron's broadband unit, which owns an 18,000 mile network, posted a loss of $80 million for the third quarter, but Lay said losses should be smaller in subsequent quarters. Enron launched its broadband business last year, predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity, but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market's early potential and has scaled down its operations. Enron's stock rose by 87 percent last year, driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of the EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform. But the stock has fallen some 59 percent so far this year as sentiment toward the broadband project soured, CEO Jeff Skilling resigned after only six months in the job and wrangling continued over Enron's stalled Dabhol power plan project in India.

USA: UPDATE 6-Enron posts loss after taking $1 bln in charges.By C. Bryson Hull10/16/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.WASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. on Tuesday reported its first loss in more than four years after taking $1.01 billion in charges on ill-fated investments, including water and telecommunications services, which it said have clouded the strength of its core energy businesses. Enron, North America's biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and power, said the charges were an attempt to put its house in order after a tumultuous year in which a new chief executive suddenly resigned and the company's stock lost two-thirds of its value as once enthusiastic investors lost faith in the company.""What we've tried to do here is clean up anything that we thought needed cleaning up to get these distractions out of the way,"" Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay said in a conference call. Lay reassumed the CEO mantle at Enron after his successor, Jeff Skilling, resigned in August after only six months at the helm. Houston-based Enron reported a third-quarter net loss of $638 million, or 84 cents a share, compared with net income of $271 million, or 34 cents a share, in the same period of 2000. It was Enron's first loss since the second quarter of 1997. The charges covered the company's loss-making broadband telecommunications business, its troubled water affiliate Azurix, and New Power Co., Enron's retail electricity joint-venture with AOL/Time Warner and IBM. Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade said it would probably take Enron a few more quarters to rebuild confidence in the company which was a Wall Street favorite just 12 months ago. ""They do a couple of things very well and if they stick to their knitting, they're a solid company, but they have stumbled when they strayed further afield,"" said Meade. Enron's stock closed 67 cents higher at $33.84 on Tuesday, but for the year it is down about 59 percent, underperforming the Standard & Poor's utilities index .SPU), which has fallen some 23 percent over the same period. ILL-FATED BUSINESSES Originally a natural gas pipeline operator, Enron seized on opportunities created by the deregulation of U.S. energy markets to become the nation's dominant wholesale marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity. The company moved into the water services business in 1998 by acquiring Britain's Wessex Water and forming Azurix, a unit which Enron took public in 1999 but had to buy back this year after it failed to meet performance targets and its stock price tumbled. Enron helped set up New Power Co. and take it public last year but its stock has since fallen from about $28 per share to less than $2 as companies have found it hard to make a profit in deregulated U.S. residential electricity markets. Enron also launched a broadband telecommunications business last year, predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity, but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market's early potential. Enron's stock soared past sector peers last year when it posted a gain of 87 percent, driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform. But the stock has fallen sharply this year as broadband sentiment soured, Skilling resigned and wrangling continued over Enron's stalled Dabhol power plan project in India. Enron's third-quarter earnings before one-time charges rose to $393 million, or 43 cents a share, from $292 million, or 34 cents a share, meeting analysts' expectations of 42 to 45 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. The company reaffirmed its previously stated earnings targets of 45 cents a share for the fourth quarter, $1.80 for all of 2001 and $2.15 for all of 2002. DEBT ON CREDIT REVIEW Rating agency Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday said it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade. The writedowns would reduce Enron's equity base, increase its nominal financial leverage and materially impact its earnings, Moody's said. Enron's third-quarter earnings report showed that income at its wholesale marketing and trading division, the company's backbone moneymaker, grew 28 percent. The division, which deals primarily in electricity and natural gas, saw pretax income rise to $754 million from $589 million in the third quarter of 2000. All of the income growth in the segment came from Enron's gas and power trading and marketing operations in the Americas, where income grew to $701 million from $536 million last year. The European segment, which includes gas and power operations there and other commodity sales like metals, coal and crude oil, remained flat at $53 million amid lower volatility. The latest earnings report marked the first time that Enron has provided a financial breakdown of the European and Americas wholesale operations. In doing so, Lay delivered on a promise he made after Skilling's departure: that he would make Enron's financial reporting more transparent. Many analysts and investors had grumbled about a lack of clarity from Enron.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 	Enron Has Third-Quarter Loss After Expansion Fails (Update9)2001-10-16 16:29 (New York)Enron Has Third-Quarter Loss After Expansion Fails (Update9)     (Adds in sixth paragraph that losses are equal to 70 percentof Enron's profits over the last four quarters. Closes shares.)     Houston, Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largestenergy trader, had a $618 million loss in the third quarter afterexpansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy salescost the company $1.01 billion.     The loss was 84 cents a share after payment of preferreddividends, Enron said. Net income a year earlier was $292 million,or 34 cents. Revenue rose 59 percent to $47.6 billion.     Investors have sent Enron stock down 60 percent this year onconcern about investments outside energy trading and natural-gaspipelines. Some investors praised Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairmanand chief executive officer, for acknowledging the failure of thenew businesses. Others said they're not confident all the bad newsis out.     ``What is disconcerting is that they didn't do this sooner,''said Donald Coxe, manager of the $352 million Harris InsightEquity Fund. ``If you kill one cockroach in the kitchen, itdoesn't mean there aren't more.''     Investors have questioned Enron's financial reporting in thepast year, especially after Jeffrey Skilling's resignation as CEOin August. Skilling, who helped Lay transform Enron from a gas-pipeline company into the top competitor in energy trading, saidhe left for personal reasons. Investors said they weren'tconfident Enron was detailing all its problems.                         Failed Businesses     The $1.01 billion in losses, which total $1.11 a share, areequal to 70 percent of Enron's $1.45 billion in profits over thepast four quarters.     Included were $544 million for losses on investments in NewPower Co., a venture formed with AOL Time Warner Inc. andInternational Business Machines Corp. New Power competes forenergy sales in states that allow consumers to choose power andgas suppliers as they do long-distance phone companies.     The $544 million also includes losses from the Enron unitthat trades space, known as bandwidth, on fiber-optic networks, aswell as for the ``early termination of certain structured financearrangements'' with an undisclosed ``entity.'' Enron wouldn't bemore specific.     Enron said restructuring the fiber-optic unit would costanother $180 million, including severance pay to 500 firedworkers. The business collapsed this year along with the fortunesof the dot-com companies that were expected to be some off itsbiggest customers.     The declining value of assets owned by Azurix Corp., itswater and sewage treatment business, will cost $287 million, Enronsaid.     Enron might take a first-quarter ``adjustment'' of less than$200 million because of accounting changes related to goodwill,Lay said in an interview. ``If we thought there were any othersignificant concerns, we would have taken care of them today,''Lay said.                         Excluding Losses     Minus the losses, Enron would have earned $393 million, or 43cents a share, up 35 percent from the year-earlier period. Thatmatched the average estimate of analysts surveyed by ThomsonFinancial/First Call.     Enron has averaged quarterly profit increases of 31 percentfor the past year. Its wholesale services business, which includesenergy trading, had income before interest, minority interests andtaxes of $754 million, up 28 percent from a year earlier.     Shares of Enron rose 67 cents to $33.84. Earlier, the stockhad risen as much as 5.2 percent to $34.90.     ``There's a sigh of relief that Enron's core businesses, itsenergy merchant businesses, are OK,'' said Roger Hamilton, whohelps manage John Hancock's Value funds, which own 600,000 shares.     Enron said it still expects to earn 45 cents a share in thefourth quarter, $1.80 for the full year and $2.15 in 2002.                     `Ridiculous Investments'     At one time, Enron pinned high hopes on the businesses thatcontributed to the $1.01 billion in losses.     Enron spent $2.8 billion in 1998 for the U.K.'s Wessex Water,from which Azurix emerged. Enron sold shares to the public in1999, and then bought back the company this year after Azurixfailed in its strategy of buying up water companies and winninglarge projects. In August, Enron agreed to sell Azurix's NorthAmerican business to American Water Works Inc. for $150 million.     In February 2000, Lay said trading bandwidth could become thecompany's fastest-growing business. In the latest quarter, thebandwidth unit's loss before interest, minority interests andtaxes widened to $80 million from $20 million a year earlier.Revenue plunged to $4 million from $162 million.     ``You can make the case that Jeff Skilling leaving was forthe best,'' John Hancock's Hamilton said. ``Under him, they builtthe best trading operation while also making all these ridiculousinvestments.''     While admitting its poor choices, Enron also supplied moreinformation this quarter about how it makes money. The companygave results of individual commodity-trading desks, includingcoal, forest products and steel.     ``I liked that they broke out the different commodities,''Hamilton said. ``I think Lay has gotten the message loud andclear, and that the effort is there.''",0

(NYSE: ENE) stock sustained further heavy losses on October 19 as investor confidence in the former Wall Street favorite remained at a low ebb after it reported its first quarterly loss in over four years. The energy giant's stock was off $3.32 or 11.45 percent at $25.68 per share at mid-day trade on Oct. 19, making a cumulative loss of 28 percent for a week in which it reported a third-quarter loss of $638 million. As of early morning trading on Oct. 22, Enron shares were priced at $21.99, a reflection of new developments (including a new Securities and Exchange inquiry) that have caused uncertainty about the company among investors. Analysis: Enron's first financial report since the departure of former CEO Jeffrey Skilling in August has not done much to once again instill investor confidence in the company, which has experienced one of its most turbulent years in recent memory. While Skilling cited personal reasons for his departure, many analysts suspected that a significant drop in Enron's share price and financial losses in its diversified businesses also played a role. At the time of Skilling's departure, Enron's stock had tumbled to a 52-week low. However, based on the new 3Q report, it now appears that Enron's downward turn may be continuing despite the return of Kenneth Lay to the company's top spot. In essence, Enron's financial problems have been caused by businesses that the company has established as a way to diversify from its core focus on wholesale power sales. It appears that Enron is learning a costly lesson-namely that investors are not responding favorably to the company's innovation, especially if bottom line performance is in any way compromised. The road ahead may remain uncertain for Enron, as a good number of unresolved issues and a new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) inquiry into financial dealings of its chief financial officer continue to overshadow the company. Let's first establish the financial losses that Enron has reported in the third quarter. As noted, as a whole the company reported $638 million in losses, after taking $1.01 billion in charges associated with several of its non-core businesses. When we break down the losses, it becomes clear that Enron is struggling with its operations in three businesses: water, broadband and the retail power market. Specifically, Enron reported $287 million in charges from Azurix, its water and wastewater business; $180 million in charges related to the downsizing of its broadband operations (including severance costs and losses on inventory sales and customer contracts); and $544 million in what the company is calling ""investment losses."" Evidently, about half of the $544-million figure is related to Enron's investment in NewPower Company, the retail electricity and natural-gas provider that Enron launched about two years ago with partners America Online and IBM. Enron owns 45 percent of NewPower. In addition, Enron's debt to total capitalization ratio reportedly will increase to about 50 percent, although Lay says that pending asset sales may reduce that amount to 40 percent by the end of 2002. However, it is important to note that Enron's 3Q recurring net income (before the write-offs) did increase 35 percent to $393 million, or 43 cents a diluted share, and revenue in the quarter rose to $47.6 billion from $30 billion in 3Q 2000. The losses associated with NewPower are particularly interesting. As one of the leading investors in the company, Enron drove NewPower's aggressive business focus on retail residential power sales, despite ongoing concerns about the development of retail competition across the United States. NewPower went public last year at an opening price of $21, and in the early days of its initial public offering was trading above that price. However, the company's stock has experienced a devastating drop in value, and is currently priced at $1.25. NewPower is not scheduled to release its own 3Q financial statement until early November, but it is expected that the company will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. Specifically, NewPower recently reiterated its earlier expectations of a 3Q loss of $65 million to $70 million, or $1.12 to $1.20 a share. Third-quarter revenue reportedly will be slightly lower than the $60 million to $65 million that the company had forecast in August. In analyzing NewPower's 2Q financial losses (see IssueAlert from 8/8/01 at www.scientech.com/rci http://www.secure.scientech.com/IssueAlert), I argued that the company is really struggling from a mix of positive and negative factors in its efforts to become the leading retail energy provider in residential and small business markets in the United States. On the positive side, NewPower has recently secured a large number of new customer accounts, most significantly from its purchase of customers and related assets from AES Corp. and DTE Energy. These purchases prompted an impressive growth spurt for NewPower, and the company reportedly now has a customer base in 22 markets in 10 states. However, the bad news for NewPower is that its losses continue to widen, apparently resulting from a combination of weather factors and financial hits absorbed in several of the states in which the company operates. This dichotomy does not appear to be getting any better, and the company's stock has continued to drop as a result. In an effort to alleviate some of its financial woes, NewPower recently revised an existing master netting agreement with Enron Corp. and several of its subsidiaries. The revised agreement essentially lowers the amount of cash collateral that NewPower is required to post to the Enron subsidiaries through Jan. 4, 2002. With the lowered financial obligations that it must make to Enron, NewPower believes that it will have sufficient financial resources to conduct its business in the near term until it secures ongoing asset-based financing. However, from Enron's perspective, the losses associated with NewPower (and, by the same token, the losses in water and broadband) have contributed to a steady drop in its own stock price. The message is clear: The businesses that Enron plunged into as a way to diversify have tainted the company as a whole. Further, what some analysts perceived as brash hubris on Enron's part has not translated into measurable profits, and consequently Wall Street has reacted by sending Enron's stock to a level that is about half of where it was a year ago. The individual sectors that Enron has pursued are all unique, but they share the common denominator of taking Enron away from what was a successful core business. Further, they are similar in that Enron aggressively sunk large sums of capital into new business lines for which it arguably had unrealistic expectations for growth. The problem with Enron's bandwidth unit is that the company has faced an unanticipated excess of fiber-optic lines, which has prevented the demand for the division's services from materializing as anticipated. The problem with Azurix, which has been losing money since its formation in 1998, is that privatization of the water sector has not materialized as quickly as Enron and other companies anticipated. In addition to these problem areas, Enron also faces challenges related to its investments in India (where it is locked into a legal battle with the state government) and California (from which Enron has yet to receive full payment for previous power sales). In addition to the losses outlined in the 3Q report, there are new issues that are brewing at the start of this week. First, the SEC has requested that Enron provide information regarding ""certain related party transactions."" Not much additional information is presently available about this inquiry. However, it is probably connected to earlier reports about concerns related to the dealings of Enron's Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who up until very recently had run a limited partnership that bought assets from Enron. Ken Lay has said that Enron will cooperate fully with the SEC's request. In a separate development, several mutual funds (including AIM Constellation that once held large positions in Enron) have either liquidated or reduced their holdings in the company, which has further weakened Enron's stock value. Portfolio managers of the mutual funds have cited concerns about Enron's ability to balance its new businesses with its core strength as an energy trader. The present challenge for Enron is to convince investors that the company remains on solid ground despite the losses. Thus, Lay has been quick to reiterate that earnings from the company's energy and gas-pipeline business are still strong. Further, Lay says that the charges reported in the third quarter should be seen as a way to ""clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses."" Nevertheless, the fact remains that Enron has invested huge amounts of money toward its diversification effort, and in addition to water and broadband the company has invested into the steel and pulp and paper sectors as well. Thus, several questions remain at this juncture. Are the losses reported in the third quarter only a temporary setback for Enron that will clear the way for the company to return to a primary focus on its core business of energy trading? Or, will the losses continue into the fourth quarter and 2002? Moving forward, will Enron once again reshape its business model and eliminate the various businesses to which investors have reacted less than favorably? Only time will tell as the industry continues to watch the developments at Enron, which is clearly a company in the midst of another wave of change.

"I finally was able to implement the new factors for power, now know as Project X.  If you have time, I would like to give you a down load on the work involved the last few months cleaning things up.  Overall VAR is reduced.  I've included some highlights below.?	Changed correlation measure to fixed contract instead of using prompt price history?	Extended factors out past prompt month to 24 months (power only), (previously was for prompt month only) o	Repeating last 12 months (seasonality) for 120 months, and scaled by ff vol?	Updated jumps from 1998 (impacts intra month books)o	Introduced regionally correlated jumps?	Mapped F curves to appropriate R and B curves ?	Captured gas leg in spread option ?	Captured gas leg in heat rate swaps ?	Corrected incorrect curve codes and data input relating to risk type (as of Sept 24)Trader			Old VAR		New VARDana Davis		2.9			1.8East VAR		15.3			13.2West VAR		14			10.4Canada			14.3			11.4	Power total		35			30.8Additionally, items on our to do list for the future include:1.

"Louise,I am meeting with Scott Josey on Thursday regarding Crescendo.  I am going to propose to him that all of Crescendo goes into ECR and he reimburses Upstream Products for incurred capital charges for 2001.   Since ECR is utilizing Nick Cocavessis's technical services organization for all infrastructure needs and he reports to Brian Redmond,  Upstream Products would not be charging ECR a fee.  The technical services organization is commercial support for Enron Americas.  I have spoken to Brian and he is fine with my proposal.  In addition, Josey and I have had a brief conversation and on Thursday, I expect to be negotiating details.Regards, Jean -----Original Message-----From: 	Kitchen, Louise  Sent:	Tuesday, April 17, 2001 11:21 AMTo:	Mrha, JeanSubject:	CresendoBearing in mind this 35%:65% split - how about we put it all in ECR and then you charge them a fee for all work you do on it.Thoughts?",0
"Louise,I spoke with Tom Byargeon this morning while he was at the Offshore Technical conference.  He has spoken with Rick Fowler, Dominion, and plans on visiting him in New Orleans next week.  The highlights from the conversations are as follows :?	By the end of this week or next, he will have information on two more total depth wells that have been drilled.  Based on the rumor mill, the reserves associated with the Devil's Tower acreage are looking even more promising.  However, nothing is definite until all data is received.?	Based on the well data, Rick has three financing options :?	Negotiate exclusively with a company like Enron?	Synthetic lease financing with a commercial bank?	Rebid?	Since Dominion is now 80% owner in Devil's Tower (bought out Mariner's 20%), the credit profile of the project looks better.  (Pioneer is the other 20%.)  Rick realizes his mistake going with a company that has no equity backing and has egg on his face with upper management.  My concern is that based on his experience, he will take the easy way out and align himself with a commercial bank.?	Enron has the following in their favor:?	Convergent and Enron's bid were very similar except Convergent had Aker.  (Dominion wanted a guarantee of an Aker spar.) Tom has spoken with Bob O'Sullivan from Aker and he is interested in aligning himself with Enron.  As such, we can bring Aker back to the table.?	Dominion wants to spend dollars on ""steel"" for the project by the end of June.  As such, Dominion will have to make a decision quickly because it will affect whether Devil's Tower becomes an on-balance or off-balance sheet transaction.  I think that Dominion would prefer an off balance sheet deal.?	Dominion won't rebid because the other counterparties were not competitive relative to Enron or Convergent.So, I think our true competition is against a commercial bank for synthetic lease financing.  Either way,  we will have an answer quickly and since the gossip on Convergent is out, I think it will stregthen our position on other spar bids (ie., Medusa).Regards, Mrha",0

"Ok So I'm having trouble letting go....... 9:00 am  Greg and I and Louise will meet with the back office to discuss staff.10:00 am  We will meet discuss staff.  We need to have further meeting later with our staff to determine if we should offer other people jobs.  We have a lot of front office spots.  Slone, you need to get us a front office count by region. I suggest that Hunter and Dave Ryan coordinate interviews for outside weather guys for next Monday.  We should bring in 10 if we can and hire 2 or 3.   I suggest Presto works with Gaskill and Will and the H guy I can't spell in Portland to put together gas and power fundies presentations for a week Tuesday.  I would like to have a clue before I start trading. Hunter on the gas trading side I say we put all front office into 4 groups and give them a task to come up with the best Organization structure.   It will get everyone working.  We need that.  I would suggest that we start projecting our groups to death so they're focused on business.

"Team:We had a very productive meeting with ABB today.  Attending the meeting from Enron's side were Drew Tingleaf, Scott Laidlaw, Carlos Sole and Mike Curry.

Both parties agreed to the following actions and schedule:1.  Enron will by April 30, 2001 (Monday):	a.  draft a letter amending and reinstating the EPC contract of 10/27/00 (the ""Letter"") and send it to ABB for their comments.	b.  draft a revised Exhibit Q (cancellation payments).2.

"I have just been informed that our P&L was overstated by approx $6 million on Friday.   Since it is quarter end, we are re-calcing to avoid numerous audit issues that would result.   The mistake was due to vol curves rolling forward one month (May became June, June became July, July became Aug, etc.).Starting tommorow, Harry will be responsible for marking all vol curves for East Power.   The vol curve changes that Harry will be making over the next two days will result in a marginal gain in desk P&L (1-2 million).   Most of the regional books gain value due to short vol position, however, the New Albany spread option loses a corresponding amount.The recent risk group difficulties are compounded by the Portland risk group being down to 2 people (total experience of 3 months) and many of our resources are getting sucked into West issues.   Continued system difficulties combined with understaffing has resulted in more frequent mistakes.The $23 million of P&L for Friday business can be reconciled as follows:$6 million from Thursday mistake (P&L understated on Thursday because Wednesday curves were used after Port Calc failed)$10 million in ""true"" Friday P&L (summer 01, Cal 02 & Cal 03 all down approx. $1/Mwh)$6 million overstated due to vol curve being off by one month from incorrect roll in vol curves.The final P&L issued by 2:00 pm today (for COB Friday) will be approx. $17 million.",0
